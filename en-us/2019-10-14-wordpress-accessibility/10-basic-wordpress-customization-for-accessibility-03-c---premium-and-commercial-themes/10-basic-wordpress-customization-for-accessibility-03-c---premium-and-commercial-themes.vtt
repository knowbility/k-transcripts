<v ->We have businesses</v>

2
00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:07.230
that have really tapped into the market of WordPress.

3
00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:15.030
And have offered highly customized experiences and designs,

4
00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:22.470
and very interactive sites

5
00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.193
that you can build with WordPress.

6
00:00:25.568 --> 00:00:30.540
This commercial theme marketplace is enormous.

7
00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:32.910
I don't even know how many millions

8
00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.690
if not billions of dollars it generates a year.

9
00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:39.580
But there are some things that we need to think about.

10
00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:40.850
So,

11
00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:42.710
with any commercial theme,

12
00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:46.700
there are no formal accessibility review processes.

13
00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:50.920
There's no accessibility ready tag that is endorsed

14
00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:55.920
by the wordpress.org theme developer community.

15
00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.980
So you have to beware of that.

16
00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:04.795
You can very good commercial themes out there,

17
00:01:04.795 --> 00:01:08.970
but it is a bit of buyer beware.

18
00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.160
They might say that things are accessible,

19
00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:14.930
but you have to verify those claims.

20
00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:19.930
And it's worth really doing some research around that.

21
00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:24.590
And you always have

22
00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:28.430
this good alternative possibility with commercial themes,

23
00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:31.460
and that is you create child themes on top of that.

24
00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:35.470
And a lot of the theme houses out there,

25
00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:39.125
the commercial theme shops,

26
00:01:39.125 --> 00:01:44.125
like StudioPress that makes Genesis theme framework,

27
00:01:46.325 --> 00:01:48.923
or elegant themes that make Divvy and other ones.

28
00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:55.260
Catch themes based out of Nepal of all places.

29
00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:59.498
They make great commercial themes,

30
00:01:59.498 --> 00:02:04.400
and they provide child themes,

31
00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:06.240
or they're child theme ready.

32
00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.451
So,

33
00:02:07.451 --> 00:02:09.990
you can do that with any child theme.

34
00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:14.250
But a lot of the bigger outfits give you guides about

35
00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.290
here's how you create a good customizable child theme

36
00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.543
for our theme framework.

37
00:02:19.543 --> 00:02:22.570
And so,

38
00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:24.610
those will allow you to

39
00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:26.800
take what's good about those commercial themes

40
00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:27.633
that you like,

41
00:02:27.633 --> 00:02:29.650
and you purchased it for,

42
00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:31.900
but then level off the accessibility,

43
00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:33.480
where it might be needed.

44
00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.670
So that's something that I will always recommend

45
00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:39.960
with anyone that's purchasing a commercial theme,

46
00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:44.960
is to look at how to make it more accessible than it is.

47
00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:50.250
And many of the commercial themes just don't have

48
00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:54.130
even a thought about accessibility into them.

49
00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:55.300
If they've inherited

50
00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:57.753
some accessibility from the WordPress defaults,

51
00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:01.930
you're doing really well.

52
00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:06.570
But a lot of times the overrides that come with some of the

53
00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:08.240
theme frameworks,

54
00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:09.500
and commercial themes,

55
00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:10.680
just wipe everything out.

56
00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.510
So everything has to be put back in from scratch

57
00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:14.993
in terms of accessibility.
