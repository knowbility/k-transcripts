00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.440
<v Robert>Any questions about any</v>

2
00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:03.400
of the common accessibility issues?

3
00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:05.480
Anyone else have other accessibility issues

4
00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:10.480
that they run into that you want to share?

5
00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:16.620
<v Man>One thing, Robert, if you don't mind covering</v>

6
00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:19.770
is the types of automated tests

7
00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.640
that Microsoft Inspector runs

8
00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.350
versus what types of things that it can't

9
00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:29.513
catch from like, automated testing.

10
00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:31.800
I think someone had an issue or a question

11
00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:32.750
about that earlier.

12
00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:35.940
<v Robert>Okay, and that's,</v>

13
00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.193
that is going to be covered a little bit,

14
00:00:39.735 --> 00:00:43.040
a little bit later in the day.

15
00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:46.730
Not to completely put that off,

16
00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:49.553
but it is something that we are going to,

17
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.500
we're going to talk about,

18
00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.250
the differences between automated tests and manual tests.

19
00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.020
And even the differences between

20
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.883
different automated tools.

21
00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.140
<v Man>Sounds good.</v>

22
00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.370
<v Robert>And Rebecca had a question.</v>

23
00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:10.910
Can I address appropriate markup and semantics

24
00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:14.563
for site identifiers like logos or the site name?

25
00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:19.940
Yes, so, the

26
00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.840
site name, I'm going to go to our AIR rally site.

27
00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.840
So we have a WordPress site, running our, open, well,

28
00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.180
our AIR competition site.

29
00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:40.060
It used to be called Open AIR for a number of years.

30
00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:42.720
And it stands for The Accessible Internet Rally.

31
00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.290
So we have a theme running here

32
00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:49.640
and then we have a child theme on here.

33
00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:54.640
But here on our home page, we have a heading level one

34
00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:00.050
around the site name, right, the site title.

35
00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:02.590
And it is AIR powered by nobility.

36
00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:05.770
So that's in a div called site branding text,

37
00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:08.980
and it is a heading level one.

38
00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:13.980
Now if I go to a secondary page, say the compete page,

39
00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:18.210
then if I look at it again,

40
00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:20.040
I'm hoping this is going to be right.

41
00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:21.270
It is.

42
00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:25.900
So the site title is now just in a paragraph element.

43
00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:30.900
And the heading level one is the title of the page.

44
00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:34.680
Which is a very good strategy, I feel,

45
00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.410
and a good convention to follow.

46
00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:41.410
It's one that is recommended in the WordPress theme handbook

47
00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:43.910
for accessibility ready themes.

48
00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:46.660
So there's a good way that you can create a conditional

49
00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:50.767
statement around your main navigation,

50
00:02:53.567 --> 00:02:55.710
your main header area,

51
00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:58.260
where if it is the homepage then wrap it

52
00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:02.350
in a heading level one, but if it's a secondary page,

53
00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:06.670
then make your heading level one be title of the page.

54
00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:10.386
So, if this were a logo instead, which it could be,

55
00:03:10.386 --> 00:03:14.090
we would still follow the same convention where our logo

56
00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:18.180
would be inside an image,

57
00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:20.860
well the image would be the logo right,

58
00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:24.730
and then we'd have alt text for that image

59
00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:26.610
that would say what it is.

60
00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:28.610
If it's AIR Powered by Knowbility,

61
00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:31.130
the Accessible Internet Rally, if that was an image,

62
00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:33.360
then we'd just have alt text saying that.

63
00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:37.690
And then, we'd wrap that in the heading level one

64
00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:41.770
for the homepage, and wrap it just in a paragraph tag

65
00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:46.770
for secondary pages that aren't the homepage.

66
00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:52.690
All right, so, making icons accessible.

67
00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:58.760
Sofia had answered that question

68
00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:01.280
that I had about what other

69
00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:03.040
common problems are there.

70
00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:06.780
And absolutely, icon accessibility

71
00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:11.570
is something that does get neglected.

72
00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:14.443
I'm going to look at this and,

73
00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:21.190
this is an icon that is accessible here.

74
00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:24.690
So this is our Facebook icon and our Twitter icon,

75
00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:26.550
our social icons on our screen.

76
00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:28.550
And you can see it's wrapped in a link,

77
00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:30.940
and it has a class of hidden texts

78
00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:32.540
called screen reader text,

79
00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:34.950
and it says "knowbility on Facebook".

80
00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:39.840
And then our svg image for the social icon

81
00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:44.840
has a role of image, but it's also hidden using aria.

82
00:04:44.866 --> 00:04:48.570
And then all the svg contents are in there.

83
00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:53.427
So basically, the image, the svg image itself is ignored

84
00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:58.460
by people using assistive technologies, but they do get

85
00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:02.040
knowbility on Facebook read out to them if they're using,

86
00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:03.930
say, a screen reader.

87
00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:08.930
So, that, if I look at the accessibility properties,

88
00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:12.160
it's a link and it's computed name

89
00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:14.410
is Knowbility on Facebook,

90
00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:16.690
because that's what's in the content of the link.

91
00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:21.690
So we hide it visibly using the screen reader text

92
00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:27.780
that's built in with WordPress, and the screen reader text

93
00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:33.070
class hides it on the screen, but makes it available

94
00:05:33.363 --> 00:05:36.750
to folks who use assistive technologies.

95
00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:38.570
So it's visibly hidden.

96
00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:41.570
And I've seen other folks use a class called VH,

97
00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:46.570
or visibly hidden, or SR for screen reader.

98
00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:50.200
So this is a built-in class and something we'll cover

99
00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:53.293
as well and in a little bit more depth in a bit.
