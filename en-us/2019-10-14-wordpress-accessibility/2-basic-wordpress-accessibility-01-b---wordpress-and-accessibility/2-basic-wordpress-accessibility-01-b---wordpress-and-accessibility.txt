- [Robert Jolly] And WordPress and Accessibility, so this is something that I'll cover a bit more in depth, But I did want to have us go over the defaults that WordPress has as well as you know, what's good about Accessibility in WordPress and why are we talking about it. And I see that there was some chat about the principals and thank you for posting that link, Christopher, for folks in the chat. It's webaim.org, Articles, POUR. So we'll go there now. So this is a very good article about the principals of Accessibility, that perceivable, operable, understandable and robust. So I don't know if you can see it on my screen, I'll see if I can zoom in a little bit here. But that's an excellent resource. So WordPress and Accessibility. There is a commitment within the Core Team of WordPress to make all of the new features and functionality of WordPress from the Core Team to meet the WCAG 2.0 guidelines at level AA. So I'm going to zoom in on this right now and we'll even highlight it for posterity. Because this is very important. So they say here, all new or updated code released in WordPress must conform with the Web Content Accessibility guidelines, 2.0 at level AA. That's great that they say that. It doesn't always happen and that is something that we'll talk about when we talk about the Gutenberg editor. I'm sure that folks have heard the commotion that was stirred up in the WordPress community when WordPress 5 and Gutenberg first came out. The Gutenberg team, the Core Team led by Automatic and folks there you know, working on WordPress, they had a number of known Accessibility issues that they had decided to launch with and not address at launch. And WP campus which is an organization of higher education institutions that have come together to work in WordPress and to support the WordPress community for their own needs, but also for the benefit of others, commissioned to Gutenberg audit and the Gutenberg audit listed a number of problems and a number of those problems, with Accessibility, with the Gutenberg editor, have been resolved. There are still a number remaining and we'll cover that for sure. But there is a core commitment, Core Team Accessibility Commitment and that speaks volumes about WordPress in general in terms of what you can do with WordPress out of the box with Accessibility. And we'll get into a tour of WordPress defaults. We can certainly do that now, I wanna open it up for any questions if folks have them, or any comments or anything you want us to dive into more deeply, before we tour the WordPress defaults.
