00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:03,710
- [Robert Jolly] And
WordPress and Accessibility,

2
00:00:03,710 --> 00:00:08,710
so this is something that I'll
cover a bit more in depth,

3
00:00:08,731 --> 00:00:13,729
But I did want to have us go over the

4
00:00:13,729 --> 00:00:18,727
defaults that WordPress has as well as

5
00:00:18,727 --> 00:00:21,300
you know, what's good about Accessibility

6
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:24,280
in WordPress and why
are we talking about it.

7
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:25,770
And I see that there was some chat about

8
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:30,770
the principals and thank
you for posting that link,

9
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:34,920
Christopher, for folks in the chat.

10
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:39,883
It's webaim.org, Articles, POUR.

11
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:42,323
So we'll go there now.

12
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:48,680
So this is a very good article about

13
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:50,710
the principals of Accessibility,

14
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:52,880
that perceivable, operable, understandable

15
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:53,763
and robust.

16
00:00:54,610 --> 00:00:56,250
So I don't know if you
can see it on my screen,

17
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:58,793
I'll see if I can zoom
in a little bit here.

18
00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:06,673
But that's an excellent resource.

19
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,793
So WordPress and Accessibility.

20
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,990
There is a commitment within the Core Team

21
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:20,340
of WordPress to make all of

22
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:25,470
the new features and functionality

23
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:28,130
of WordPress from the Core Team to meet

24
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:31,970
the WCAG 2.0 guidelines at level AA.

25
00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:34,330
So I'm going to zoom in on this right now

26
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:36,980
and we'll even highlight it for posterity.

27
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:40,440
Because this is very important.

28
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:45,440
So they say here, all new
or updated code released

29
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:48,110
in WordPress must conform with

30
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:50,620
the Web Content Accessibility guidelines,

31
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:54,113
2.0 at level AA.

32
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:57,343
That's great that they say that.

33
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:01,070
It doesn't always happen
and that is something

34
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:02,410
that we'll talk about when we talk about

35
00:02:02,410 --> 00:02:03,530
the Gutenberg editor.

36
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:07,020
I'm sure that folks have heard the

37
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:11,970
commotion that was stirred up in

38
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:15,830
the WordPress community when WordPress 5

39
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:18,403
and Gutenberg first came out.

40
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:23,210
The Gutenberg team, the Core Team led by

41
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:26,360
Automatic and folks there you know,

42
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,623
working on WordPress,

43
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:34,320
they had a number of
known Accessibility issues

44
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,840
that they had decided to launch with

45
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:40,290
and not address at launch.

46
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:45,290
And WP campus which is an organization

47
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:49,630
of higher education institutions

48
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:54,280
that have come together
to work in WordPress

49
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:56,010
and to support the WordPress community

50
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:58,800
for their own needs, but also
for the benefit of others,

51
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,530
commissioned to Gutenberg audit

52
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:05,530
and the Gutenberg audit listed a number

53
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:09,400
of problems and a number
of those problems,

54
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,950
with Accessibility, with
the Gutenberg editor,

55
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:13,100
have been resolved.

56
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:15,020
There are still a number remaining

57
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:17,480
and we'll cover that for sure.

58
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:20,150
But there is a core commitment,

59
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:22,590
Core Team Accessibility Commitment

60
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:26,540
and that speaks volumes
about WordPress in general

61
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:30,780
in terms of what you can
do with WordPress out

62
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:32,393
of the box with Accessibility.

63
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:39,020
And we'll get into a tour
of WordPress defaults.

64
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:40,530
We can certainly do that now,

65
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:43,010
I wanna open it up for any questions

66
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:46,793
if folks have them, or any comments

67
00:03:46,793 --> 00:03:49,540
or anything you want us
to dive into more deeply,

68
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:52,283
before we tour the WordPress defaults.
