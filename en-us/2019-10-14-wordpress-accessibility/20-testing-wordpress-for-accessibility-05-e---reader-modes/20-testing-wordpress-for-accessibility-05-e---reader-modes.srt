1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:04,250
- [Instructor] So the Firefox browser

2
00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:07,870
offers a Reader-Mode for websites.

3
00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:12,870
So this can be especially
handy when you're browsing

4
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:15,200
but there's a lot of dense content,

5
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:18,367
or a lot of noise even from advertisements

6
00:00:18,367 --> 00:00:22,940
or side-bar widgets that don't really

7
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:24,270
have anything to do with the article

8
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:25,810
that you want to read.

9
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:29,360
So what browser manufacturers have done,

10
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:30,773
and especially on mobile devices,

11
00:00:30,773 --> 00:00:32,535
is they've enabled this reader-mode

12
00:00:32,535 --> 00:00:37,407
to strip away the superfluous information

13
00:00:37,407 --> 00:00:39,564
or the extraneous information,

14
00:00:39,564 --> 00:00:44,142
that isn't core to what
you're there to read about.

15
00:00:44,142 --> 00:00:47,095
And it can be particularly helpful

16
00:00:47,095 --> 00:00:52,095
when you have ads loading or
auto-playing videos on sites.

17
00:00:52,389 --> 00:00:57,343
Because that can just
destroy the user experience.

18
00:00:57,343 --> 00:01:01,013
So the reader-mode operates

19
00:01:01,013 --> 00:01:03,540
maybe a little bit differently

20
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:06,262
in each browser implementation.

21
00:01:06,262 --> 00:01:09,790
But the essence is is
that it will try to find

22
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:11,960
what is the main content of the site

23
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:13,550
and strip away everything else.

24
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:16,900
So anything that it knows
is from an ad-network

25
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:18,274
or from a 3rd-party-call,

26
00:01:18,274 --> 00:01:21,883
it typically removes but it keeps images

27
00:01:21,883 --> 00:01:24,141
if they're in line with the article,

28
00:01:24,141 --> 00:01:28,510
and keeps headings and the
paragraphs that are there.

29
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:30,290
Which you have to have
good document structure

30
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:32,867
for that to be present.

31
00:01:32,867 --> 00:01:35,560
So I'm gonna fire-up Firefox,

32
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:40,320
and this is going to be an
interesting experiment here.

33
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:45,320
So let me just pull-up a site
where that might be present.

34
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,423
So I'll pull-up a news site,

35
00:01:51,423 --> 00:01:56,190
Washington-Post because I
know that they have ads.

36
00:01:56,190 --> 00:02:01,190
And if I can type and I can get there.

37
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:04,210
So they have ads, they have videos,

38
00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:07,330
they have like 3rd party content in here.

39
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:10,745
They have different side-bar
content calls-to-action.

40
00:02:10,745 --> 00:02:14,240
So that is all well-and-good.

41
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:17,020
But what if I want to read an article?

42
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:18,900
And let me find something that is...

43
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:22,103
Okay.

44
00:02:22,103 --> 00:02:24,910
Here's something that hopefully is not as

45
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:33,670
politically troublesome as some
of the other news articles,

46
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:34,720
that we see these days.

47
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,210
But see here we have an ad for Google Fi,

48
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:38,780
up at the top,

49
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:43,600
and we have this navigation
here called By The Way

50
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:46,030
which is the section of
the site that we're in.

51
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:47,100
And then there's a video

52
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:49,717
and all the content for the article.

53
00:02:49,717 --> 00:02:51,200
And it has some stuff from Twitter

54
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:54,418
some more ads throughout the site,

55
00:02:54,418 --> 00:02:56,260
you know it's kinda disturbing,

56
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:59,940
how many ads I'm getting
bombarded with as I view.

57
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:03,170
But there's this Reader-View
which is fantastic.

58
00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:07,740
So I turn that on and basically,

59
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:09,257
this strips down the article.

60
00:03:09,257 --> 00:03:13,850
And I don't see any
more ads for Google Fi.

61
00:03:13,850 --> 00:03:17,350
As much as I might love that service,

62
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:21,245
they're not gonna convince me
by bombarding me like that.

63
00:03:21,245 --> 00:03:24,030
But the article is nice and readable.

64
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:26,733
It goes into a single column format.

65
00:03:26,733 --> 00:03:31,733
And then we get some other
I guess related articles,

66
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:34,360
or maybe other different articles

67
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,910
that they're trying to promote,

68
00:03:37,728 --> 00:03:38,561
at the bottom of the article.

69
00:03:38,561 --> 00:03:40,560
But it really simplifies the experience,

70
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,223
and removes a lot of the
clutter and the noise.

71
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:47,400
On mobile devices it's
something you can easily

72
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:51,201
do at Safari on an iOS device,

73
00:03:51,201 --> 00:03:54,520
Like an iPhone or an iPad.

74
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:56,924
And I'm sure that on Android and Chrome,

75
00:03:56,924 --> 00:03:58,880
there are ways to...

76
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:06,000
You know make the reading
experience easier and better.

77
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,144
So what this reader-mode does for Firefox

78
00:04:10,144 --> 00:04:12,550
and you can change some of
the settings here on the left

79
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:15,410
but what this does is it can help

80
00:04:15,410 --> 00:04:17,241
with accessibility obviously.

81
00:04:17,241 --> 00:04:20,290
If your eyes are tired,

82
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:22,790
after a long day of looking at the screen,

83
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:25,335
like you all are experiencing right now,

84
00:04:25,335 --> 00:04:28,600
changing the background color to Sepia,

85
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:33,018
and making it less dark of
a contrast with the text,

86
00:04:33,018 --> 00:04:36,240
Can help make the text still readable,

87
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,310
but a little easier on the eyes.

88
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:42,540
But you know reduce
the eye-strain on that.

89
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:46,200
You also get rid of all
of this information.

90
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,560
It could be cognitive over-load

91
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,230
for someone with a cognitive issue,

92
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:51,293
and needs that for accessibility.

93
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:56,889
So Debra had posted a link.

94
00:04:56,889 --> 00:04:59,400
How to turn on reader-mode
for your browser,

95
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:02,993
for Chrome, Firefox, Edge,
Opera, and Safari in the chat.

96
00:05:02,993 --> 00:05:05,640
So there's an article that
was recently published

97
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:06,943
about how to do that.

98
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:10,840
Which you know we can
all benefit from that.

99
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:15,840
But there are folks that
will look for the ability

100
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:19,879
to change the interface in an easy way,

101
00:05:19,879 --> 00:05:22,740
when things get overwhelming.

102
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:26,528
And I do know of someone who
has a traumatic brain injury,

103
00:05:26,528 --> 00:05:29,343
who really does get overwhelmed

104
00:05:29,343 --> 00:05:32,260
by very busy information on the site.

105
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:35,290
Or things that change or
get added to the interface

106
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:36,790
as you scroll-through it,

107
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:38,990
like all of those Google
ads that we were seeing

108
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:40,210
in the main article.

109
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:42,458
So with something like this,

110
00:05:42,458 --> 00:05:46,430
she can go in and click
a button in a setting

111
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:48,670
and change that experience for her.

112
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:50,980
So she can dig in and read
the article and focus,

113
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:52,960
and not get distracted or overwhelmed

114
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:56,682
by all of that information

115
00:05:56,682 --> 00:05:58,970
that's coming at you at once,

116
00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:00,423
and begging for attention.

117
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:05,010
So reader-mode is fantastic.

118
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:07,570
I don't think you have
to do anything special

119
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:09,490
to support that other than coding

120
00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:11,500
your site with semantics in mind,

121
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:14,585
giving your site good proper structures

122
00:06:14,585 --> 00:06:18,810
like good landmark information.

123
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:23,040
Like using the main element
for your main content.

124
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:26,782
Using a side-elements
for side-bar contents.

125
00:06:26,782 --> 00:06:30,060
Using navigation elements for the nav.

126
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:35,060
All of those basic html structures,

127
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,590
if you're presenting them to the browser,

128
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:39,040
the browser will know what to do

129
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:43,253
to strip-away the extraneous content.

130
00:06:44,295 --> 00:06:46,880
And a lot of this you know happens

131
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,160
with good modern responsive design.

132
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:51,500
All of this is enabled by that.

133
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:55,461
So definitely use those best practices.

134
00:06:55,461 --> 00:06:59,322
And the user experience,

135
00:06:59,322 --> 00:07:02,920
that folks who are visiting
your site or using your site,

136
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,940
is going to increase greatly

137
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:09,826
with the aid of these browser
features and extensions.

138
00:07:09,826 --> 00:07:12,760
Some people also have
their custom style sheets

139
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:14,270
that strip-away different things.

140
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:16,166
And they have them for specific sites,

141
00:07:16,166 --> 00:07:21,137
so that they make them more
accessible and better for them.

142
00:07:21,137 --> 00:07:23,530
So user style sheets are something

143
00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:26,190
that will, most likely, always be around.

144
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:30,780
And while most folks who
use them are advanced,

145
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:35,780
technologically you know they
are things that people do to,

146
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,020
say change the letter-spacing

147
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:42,713
or the line-height and line-spacing.

148
00:07:42,713 --> 00:07:47,200
So you know allowing folks to
do that without site-breaking,

149
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,613
is a real art form.
