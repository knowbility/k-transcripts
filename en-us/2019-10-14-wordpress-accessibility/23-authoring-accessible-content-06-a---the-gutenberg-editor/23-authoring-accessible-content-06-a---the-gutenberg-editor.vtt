00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:00.913
<v Lecturer>Let's talk about</v>

2
00:00:00.913 --> 00:00:02.559
authoring accessible Wordpress content.

3
00:00:02.559 --> 00:00:07.559
This is something that is as important

4
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.900
as making your theme support accessibility.

5
00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:18.900
So we have the Gutenberg Editor and too much fanfare

6
00:00:19.888 --> 00:00:24.480
then also too much consternation, hand-wringing,

7
00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.480
and loud proclamations of malfeasance around accessibility.

8
00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:33.086
We came out with a list

9
00:00:33.086 --> 00:00:35.923
of known accessibility issues with Gutenberg.

10
00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.900
Gutenberg is supposed to be the future of editing

11
00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:40.860
within Wordpress.

12
00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.410
To have block-based content.

13
00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:46.915
To make it easier and a better product to use.

14
00:00:46.915 --> 00:00:49.470
However, with accessibility,

15
00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:53.630
it just wasn't really addressed.

16
00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:56.738
In fact it was outright dismissed

17
00:00:56.738 --> 00:01:00.192
by the core team working on Gutenberg

18
00:01:00.192 --> 00:01:02.030
and that's unfortunate.

19
00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:04.060
I think these people are good people

20
00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:07.370
that just didn't value the feedback

21
00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:09.653
from the accessibility team at the time.

22
00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.940
Now we have a number of issues open for accessibility.

23
00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:19.940
They've closed 868 issues that were tagged

24
00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:21.350
with accessibility.

25
00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:24.160
So they've been working hard on this.

26
00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:26.780
They have 215 of them open.

27
00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:28.770
And these are open in various states.

28
00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.200
People have worked on these issues in some way.

29
00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.590
Some are ready for review and publishing.

30
00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.650
Some of them need additional feedback

31
00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:39.070
or design feedback or something.

32
00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:41.320
Some issues just haven't been addressed.

33
00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:44.590
Gutenberg is problematic for people

34
00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:49.100
who need accessibility support in the authoring interface.

35
00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:50.650
It will remain problematic

36
00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:55.650
until they fix all of the issues or most of the issues.

37
00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:03.130
So with that said, Gutenberg is out in the wild,

38
00:02:05.984 --> 00:02:08.520
but it's not ready for primetime

39
00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:14.440
if your team needs an accessible interface to work with.

40
00:02:15.276 --> 00:02:19.550
We have the option of installing the classic editor.

41
00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:21.700
That's something that we can definitely do.

42
00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.490
One good thing is that

43
00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:29.730
if you are using the Gutenberg editor,

44
00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.250
you can still author accessible content.

45
00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:36.600
You just have to know what to do with that.

46
00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:40.200
That's what this whole section of content today

47
00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.416
after our break is about.

48
00:02:42.416 --> 00:02:44.320
What do we need to keep in mind

49
00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:46.623
as we author this accessible content.

50
00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:52.410
You can still do it with Gutenberg and I'm confident

51
00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:57.410
that the efforts of the core team that works on Gutenberg,

52
00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:00.610
the folks at automatic, who dedicate a lot

53
00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:04.040
of their staff time to core team development,

54
00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.006
they are interested in this.

55
00:03:06.006 --> 00:03:10.260
I feel like they had an embarrassing wake up call

56
00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.990
about accessibility and the way that they treated it.

57
00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:16.760
With their release of Gutenberg it was ham-handed at best.

58
00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:22.620
Enough of the tongue-lashing of Wordpress core team

59
00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:25.942
and Automatic at this point though.

60
00:03:25.942 --> 00:03:30.010
I do want to say, they are genuinely interested

61
00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:34.070
in fixing the problems that they had introduced.

62
00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:36.970
I just wish they hadn't done it in the first place.

63
00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:39.040
So we have the classic editor as well

64
00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:41.720
and that is something that I would recommend for anyone

65
00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:46.720
that has a diverse team of folks that include people

66
00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:50.980
with disabilities.

67
00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:52.160
The fact of the matter is,

68
00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:57.160
if you code a site that requires the Gutenberg editor

69
00:03:57.656 --> 00:04:01.940
to maintain the content, hopefully that's not the case,

70
00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:04.570
but if you do that, then you lock yourself into that.

71
00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:09.150
If by some chance you need that accessible interface

72
00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:10.980
and can't switch to classic editor,

73
00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:12.795
then you're in a bit of a bind.

74
00:04:12.795 --> 00:04:17.795
So definitely work on ensuring

75
00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:21.480
that the classic editor is fine to use with any theme

76
00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:26.480
that you develop or put into place.
