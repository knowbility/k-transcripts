00:00:00,325 --> 00:00:01,420
- [Instructor] So let's talk about

2
00:00:01,420 --> 00:00:04,086
content structure, itself.

3
00:00:04,086 --> 00:00:06,500
There's accessible document structure

4
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:11,210
in pages and posts that
we like to refer to

5
00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:13,600
and that includes a number of things.

6
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:15,550
So, we have our title,

7
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:18,770
the title of the HTML page or post.

8
00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:22,610
So, you know, the title of one of my posts

9
00:00:22,610 --> 00:00:24,493
was My Inaccessible Post.

10
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:28,880
So, that was what goes
inside the title element

11
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:30,870
and within the head of the document,

12
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:32,730
and that is something that gets announced

13
00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:35,770
any time that a screen reader

14
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:38,950
comes to the, to the site
and loads up that page.

15
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:41,470
That'll be the first
thing that gets announced,

16
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:42,730
is the page title.

17
00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:45,430
So it needs to be unique and descriptive,

18
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:47,300
doesn't need to be too verbose,

19
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:52,300
but it should be unique
for each page of the site.

20
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:55,990
It should be appropriate for that page.

21
00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:57,590
Then you have headings hierarchy.

22
00:00:57,590 --> 00:00:59,910
So, each page should have one,

23
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:01,270
and only one,

24
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:03,050
heading level one.

25
00:01:03,050 --> 00:01:06,410
Then, after that your headings hierarchy

26
00:01:06,410 --> 00:01:09,600
should flow with the natural outline order

27
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:10,860
of heading level two.

28
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:13,790
Then if you have another
heading after that

29
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:15,110
it can be a heading level two,

30
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:16,780
or it can be heading level three,

31
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:18,730
but you wanna nest your headings levels

32
00:01:20,354 --> 00:01:22,110
in the logical order.

33
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:25,770
If your heading levels
aren't in that logical order,

34
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:27,290
that can cause some problems.

35
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:28,980
It's probably minor,

36
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:31,120
as long as you have a
good heading level one

37
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:32,390
and there's only one of them.

38
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:34,130
If you have six heading level one's

39
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:36,050
and they're all different on the page

40
00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:38,220
someone using a system technology

41
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:40,080
might misunderstand what the

42
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:41,210
purpose of the page is,

43
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:44,450
or at least have difficulties

44
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:45,520
ferreting that out.

45
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,280
Like is it the first heading level one?

46
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,500
Or was that something else?

47
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:49,333
You know?

48
00:01:49,333 --> 00:01:50,530
What are you using the heading level ones

49
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:52,600
for if you have that many?

50
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,390
So, its important to think about that

51
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:55,720
and try as best you can

52
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:59,470
to keep a logical heading hierarchy

53
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:00,843
that doesn't skip levels.

54
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:04,270
Then we have lists.

55
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:06,230
So, using lists appropriately.

56
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:09,030
Ordered lists, unordered lists,

57
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:11,090
as well as definition lists.

58
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:13,700
Making sure those are used where they are

59
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:15,460
most appropriate.

60
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:17,973
And using semantic content for that.

61
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:21,210
And then tables as well.

62
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:23,810
So, for tabular data, there are ways

63
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:28,810
you can mark that up
using divs, and spans,

64
00:02:29,388 --> 00:02:32,030
and most of us have gotten away from

65
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:33,750
table based layouts.

66
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:34,900
Using tables for layout.

67
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:37,660
But, there is a use case for having

68
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:39,740
data tables on a page,

69
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:44,520
and understanding how
to put those in place

70
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:48,730
is incredibly important
for content authors.

71
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:51,400
So, doing that, and doing that

72
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,300
in an accessible way isn't that hard,

73
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:55,250
but it just takes a little forethought.
