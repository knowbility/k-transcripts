00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:01,330
- [Instructor] Let's start talking about

2
00:00:01,330 --> 00:00:04,003
Basic WordPress Customization
for Accessibility.

3
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:09,320
So, many of you know this.

4
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:10,220
Some of you may not,

5
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:13,570
but there are themes that
you install for WordPress

6
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:18,350
and there is an entire set of themes

7
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:21,740
that are tagged accessibility ready.

8
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:25,530
So, the Theme Repository
or the Theme Directory

9
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:26,830
on WordPress.org

10
00:00:32,303 --> 00:00:36,630
has a series of tags and these
Accessibility Ready Themes

11
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:40,390
it looks like there are
about 101 of them right now

12
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:42,770
that you can select and install.

13
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:46,630
And these are all themes
that are open-source and free

14
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:50,790
to be able to get into the
WordPress Theme Directory.

15
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:55,610
So, you can see that
it has the default 2019

16
00:00:55,610 --> 00:00:57,470
that ships with WordPress 5,

17
00:00:57,470 --> 00:01:00,270
but it also has a number of other themes

18
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:03,100
from third-party developers
that have uploaded them

19
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:07,230
to the WordPress Theme Directory.

20
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:11,060
Now, there are standards

21
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:16,060
and checks that have to be
passed in order for these themes

22
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:20,943
to get the Accessibility
Ready Tag in WordPress.

23
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:25,630
We'll cover some of that next.

24
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:28,430
But we can look at these themes

25
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:32,090
and you can see this one is called Radon.

26
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:35,600
And it talks about what it is,

27
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,853
but it has the Accessibility Ready Tag.

28
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,970
It should allow you to create a

29
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:46,833
very accessible experience.

30
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:52,210
None of this guarantees that
just because you're going

31
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:53,890
to use the Radon Theme

32
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:57,070
that it's going to pass
every accessibility check

33
00:01:57,070 --> 00:01:58,810
with your content.

34
00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:00,970
It just means that it passed the checks

35
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:03,460
that are in the Theme Developers Handbook

36
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:05,760
for that particular tag.

37
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:10,120
And they are extensive checks,

38
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:13,470
and there's a backlog of themes

39
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:15,900
that are waiting for people to review them

40
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:20,143
for the accessibility-ready designation.

41
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:23,400
I can already see in this screenshot.

42
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,960
It says, Business WordPress Theme

43
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:27,290
with text over top of an image.

44
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:29,440
And then it has even smaller text

45
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:34,440
on top of that image under the
headline, and it's a Carousel

46
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:36,940
that looks like it has
low-contrast buttons

47
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:40,460
and the blue is possibly
low contrast on it.

48
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:42,350
So, there are a number of things

49
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:45,140
that cause me to think that

50
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:49,040
this while it is accessibility ready

51
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,120
it would need further customization

52
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:55,800
to make fully accessible if
I were to use that theme.

53
00:02:55,800 --> 00:03:00,173
So, we have these
Accessibility Ready Themes.

54
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:05,210
And I talked about this Theme
Review for Accessibility

55
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:06,423
in the handbook.

56
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:14,740
So, the required Theme Review
Team, accessibility ready

57
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:20,210
guidelines here.

58
00:03:20,210 --> 00:03:24,210
So, it takes you through
if you're a theme developer

59
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:28,540
all of what you need
to do that are required

60
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:31,050
aspects of your theme.

61
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:34,990
So, you must have keyboard navigation.

62
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:38,060
You must have accessible controls.

63
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:40,440
You must have skip links.

64
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:45,440
Your forms must
appropriately be labeled and

65
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:48,853
that they even give you how to test them.

66
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:53,440
They have information on headings

67
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:58,440
and reference articles from other folks

68
00:03:58,710 --> 00:04:00,580
to basically

69
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:04,410
give you guidance on that.

70
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:06,970
ARIA Landmarks, so I talked
a little bit about landmarks.

71
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:08,830
So what goes into that

72
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:10,610
and how do you test it?

73
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:14,305
Content links and Repetitive Link Text.

74
00:04:14,305 --> 00:04:18,187
It tells you how to use that
screen reader text class, and

75
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,650
make accessible continue reading links

76
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:24,190
or read more text

77
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:28,140
with appending the title of the article

78
00:04:29,937 --> 00:04:31,080
into the link

79
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:34,403
for any continue reading link.

80
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,193
Contrast checks.

81
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:39,323
Images.

82
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,420
Multimedia.

83
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:44,910
Has the screen reader text.

84
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:49,910
And then what is not allowed
for Accessibility Ready Themes.

85
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:54,480
So, there are just a number of things

86
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,980
that have to go into that.

87
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:59,213
And then they have a number
of recommended items.

88
00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:04,210
So, having zoomable text.

89
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:07,573
Make sure the text-only zoom
is enabled with your theme.

90
00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:14,000
Making sure that the text doesn't break,

91
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,950
doesn't overlap when you zoom in.

92
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:18,230
So, I'm using browser zoom right now,

93
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:22,100
if you have noticed, and
I'm up to 200% right now.

94
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:25,223
And nothing breaks on this site, too,

95
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,890
in terms of the layout.

96
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:30,730
So, I'm able to continue reading this

97
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:32,680
and demonstrating this.

98
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:35,190
And the other thing that they recommend

99
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:37,250
is removing of the title attribute.

100
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:40,550
So, you notice the media
library had the title attributes

101
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:44,890
on some of the media items
that I'd imported in.

102
00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:49,020
And those title attributes are repetitive.

103
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:51,770
And if you have alt text,

104
00:05:51,770 --> 00:05:53,520
you don't need the title attribute.

105
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:57,010
And some title attributes are just put

106
00:05:57,010 --> 00:05:59,810
onto post titles and into permalinks,

107
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:02,790
and those can be removed as well.

108
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:07,940
So, those are certainly
things that you can do.

109
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:10,850
But the Accessibility Ready Themes

110
00:06:11,890 --> 00:06:14,630
and the process that you go through

111
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:17,440
to get those passed

112
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,850
and accepted, and have your theme,

113
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:22,676
have the Accessibility Ready Tag

114
00:06:22,676 --> 00:06:25,983
is fairly, fairly extensive.

115
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:31,720
They do have a disclaimer here

116
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:34,340
that the themes labeled
accessibility ready

117
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:37,710
have met the required
guidelines that are listed

118
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:40,040
by the WordPress Theme Review Team.

119
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:43,210
But they don't give you
a stamp of approval,

120
00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:46,283
no formal accessibility requirements.

121
00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:50,980
It doesn't mean that
your theme fully meets

122
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:52,840
the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines

123
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:57,400
to at Level Double-A,
it doesn't mean that.

124
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:00,120
And there are a number of other things

125
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,830
that you'll need to do.

126
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:04,070
So, does anybody have any questions?

127
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:06,470
Oh, it looks like if you
remove the title attribute,

128
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:08,180
will it hurt SEO?

129
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:09,730
And that's from Kenneth.

130
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:11,130
I don't believe so.

131
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:15,690
There are probably better
resources out there,

132
00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:19,403
and certainly Yoast for SEO.

133
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:24,193
He has an excellent plugin.

134
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:29,750
So, Yoast SEO.

135
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:32,803
If we look at that yoast.com,

136
00:07:35,457 --> 00:07:37,440
this would be my go-to resource

137
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,590
for anything SEO-related for WordPress.

138
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:44,710
There are other SEO
M-O-Z, SEO MOZ, that site

139
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:52,300
has excellent SEO resources as well.

140
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:55,230
I believe the title attribute

141
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,100
will not help you with accessibility

142
00:07:58,100 --> 00:07:59,963
when it comes to images.

143
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:03,053
If you have alt text on the images,

144
00:08:04,406 --> 00:08:07,420
that is picked up by SEO and that will

145
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:08,930
or by search engines.

146
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:10,000
And that will help.

147
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,870
The title attribute
could help in some way,

148
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:15,490
but I think that the negative aspects

149
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:18,633
of how that is redundant text,

150
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:21,320
especially for people who have

151
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:24,900
a verbose screen reader setting.

152
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:28,330
If the title attribute is
repeated with the alt attribute,

153
00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:30,470
that can get pretty annoying very quickly.

154
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:35,140
So, those concerns outweigh
any potential benefits

155
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:36,300
of using a title attribute.

156
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:38,570
And actually if you're
using an alt attribute

157
00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:41,050
that is in my opinion

158
00:08:41,050 --> 00:08:43,230
better than the title attribute,

159
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:48,230
just because you're getting that content,

160
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:54,403
an actual place on the page
versus having the title itself.

161
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:00,070
The alt is the text alternative
to image-based content.

162
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:02,140
So, if you're using the alt attribute

163
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:05,910
and putting that in place,

164
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:08,800
then that's what you
definitely want to do.

165
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,720
And I have seen where certain plugins

166
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:14,890
there's a NextGEN Image Gallery Plugin

167
00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:18,130
that is very popular for photographers

168
00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:22,930
and for other highly image-based sites.

169
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:26,050
And their recommendation

170
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:29,460
is to use both the
title and alt attribute.

171
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:31,430
I don't agree with that.

172
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:35,053
But it is possible that
you could use both.

173
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:38,020
The title of the page, yes,

174
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:42,570
Sumner had a great chat answer there.

175
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:44,590
The title of the page is important to SEO.

176
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:47,933
That is probably one of the
most important things to SEO.

177
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:53,460
The title of the page comes up

178
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:56,660
in your Google results.

179
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:58,910
So, this is the title
of the page right here,

180
00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:02,240
this Yoast SEO: the Number
One WordPress SEO Plugin,

181
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,550
and then it has a dot

182
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:05,650
and then Yoast.

183
00:10:05,650 --> 00:10:07,590
So that's the Google
search result listing.

184
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:11,065
And then the title of
this page is exactly that.

185
00:10:11,065 --> 00:10:14,950
So, in terms of the title of the page,

186
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:17,350
yes, it's super important for SEO.

187
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:20,750
But the title attribute,

188
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:22,060
so there's a title element

189
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:23,940
and then there are title attributes.

190
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:27,010
So, if we inspect Yoast's page,

191
00:10:27,010 --> 00:10:28,310
we'll see in the head

192
00:10:30,010 --> 00:10:31,490
this has a page title.

193
00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:32,640
So, this page title is

194
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:37,150
Yoast SEO: the Number
One WordPress SEO Plugin,

195
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:41,450
then it has a round dot,
a bullet, and then Yoast.

196
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:43,340
So that is great.

197
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:45,690
Now, we'll look and see

198
00:10:45,690 --> 00:10:49,160
if there are title
attributes anywhere else.

199
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:50,980
Yes, there are somewhere.

200
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:55,480
Or maybe not, yes, there are
linked titles that are in

201
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:57,423
oh, that's in the head, too, so.

202
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:04,150
Yes, so there are some

203
00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:09,583
title attributes that
they're using on links.

204
00:11:09,583 --> 00:11:14,583
And that is something that you can do, but

205
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:18,210
I wouldn't necessarily

206
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,610
rely on the title attribute

207
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:25,800
on certain things.

208
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,890
And I'm looking through it here in

209
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:31,360
in the source code.

210
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,500
And I'm not finding a lot of use

211
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,560
of the title attribute here,

212
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:37,463
except on iframes.

213
00:11:39,014 --> 00:11:40,585
And so that's good.

214
00:11:40,585 --> 00:11:45,540
So, even their images,
so this Yoast image here

215
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:48,400
that I'm looking at, oh, that's an SVG.

216
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:52,570
So, their SVG is a hidden image,

217
00:11:52,570 --> 00:11:56,070
because it's decorative, I
guess, here in this instance.

218
00:11:56,070 --> 00:11:59,713
So, that is a good thing.

219
00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:03,370
So, there's SEO training
and SEO blog here.

220
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:04,900
I'm gonna look and see if

221
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:08,023
any of these images
have a title attribute.

222
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:13,460
These have blank alt attributes, and

223
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:15,213
looking to see

224
00:12:15,213 --> 00:12:17,380
and they do not use the
title attribute at all.

225
00:12:19,022 --> 00:12:21,222
And they don't use it
on their link as well.

226
00:12:22,966 --> 00:12:27,420
That's probably good advice to follow

227
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:33,450
is if Yoast is not using
titles for their images

228
00:12:33,450 --> 00:12:34,363
on their site,

229
00:12:35,450 --> 00:12:37,400
and they are the SEO experts,

230
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:41,170
then I would probably
not use a title attribute

231
00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:43,680
on an image or a link,

232
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,533
unless you absolutely have to.
