00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:02.650
<v Instructor>One thing that you can do</v>

2
00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:05.430
is that if you like, overall,

3
00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:10.430
the structure that an accessibility-ready theme has,

4
00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:16.330
you can build a child theme on top of it and create

5
00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:20.350
your customizations for that.

6
00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:22.730
So that's one of the things that we've done here,

7
00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:25.890
is we picked an accessibility-ready theme

8
00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.640
out of the Theme Directory for WordPress.

9
00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.090
This one happens to be called Reykjavik,

10
00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:37.090
so it has some accessibility supports by default,

11
00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:41.860
because it passed those checks,

12
00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:43.870
but we did our own customizations,

13
00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:45.990
and we created a child theme on top of that.

14
00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:49.710
What that allows us to do is, through child theming,

15
00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.970
we're able to make changes

16
00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:57.540
and customizations on top of that base theme that we have,

17
00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:59.077
that parent theme of Reykjavik,

18
00:00:59.077 --> 00:01:01.630
and add our own code on top

19
00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:06.630
that might be just CSS, or it might be changes

20
00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:08.466
to the structure of something

21
00:01:08.466 --> 00:01:13.466
like, you know, like how these bullets lay out, right,

22
00:01:16.871 --> 00:01:20.330
or you know, what background image comes through,

23
00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:25.023
or you know, how these buttons work and look here,

24
00:01:29.618 --> 00:01:32.810
and you know, what we do to add, say,

25
00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:34.370
skip back to the main navigation

26
00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:37.293
or what we do with forms.

27
00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:41.530
So we can, through our child theme,

28
00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:44.628
override the defaults that are in the parent theme,

29
00:01:44.628 --> 00:01:49.057
and that allows us to update that parent theme

30
00:01:49.057 --> 00:01:51.290
without breaking the changes.

31
00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:55.700
So one thing that we had was we had some Google fonts that,

32
00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:58.040
or not Google fonts, we had Typekit fonts,

33
00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:02.040
so this theme uses Google fonts, and the parent theme does,

34
00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.360
and we created Typekit fonts for this,

35
00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:07.960
so we wanted to use some Typekit fonts.

36
00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:10.930
That's all great, but the parent theme didn't support it,

37
00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:15.930
so we added it in, and one of the things that we did

38
00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:17.720
is when we first started working

39
00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.315
with the parent theme, Reykjavik,

40
00:02:20.315 --> 00:02:24.100
someone added the fonts to Typekit

41
00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:27.135
in the parent theme, and then,

42
00:02:27.135 --> 00:02:29.277
I came along, and I said, "Okay, I'm gonna take

43
00:02:29.277 --> 00:02:30.717
"all these customizations, and I'm gonna put them

44
00:02:30.717 --> 00:02:31.940
"in a child theme."

45
00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:34.090
Well, I forgot about the Typekit fonts.

46
00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:38.600
I did all the other things, and we created a child theme,

47
00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:42.883
and we have all our overrides in it, and then,

48
00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:46.246
we launched the site, and everything was looking great,

49
00:02:46.246 --> 00:02:51.246
and the other day, I went in, and I made some updates,

50
00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:53.370
so of course, WordPress,

51
00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:55.720
you know, you have a lot of updates happen.

52
00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:58.008
You have plugin updates, you have theme updates,

53
00:02:58.008 --> 00:03:02.640
and this theme developer, who's very responsible,

54
00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.063
I think it's WebMan Themes out of Europe,

55
00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:09.050
they updated the Reykjavik theme,

56
00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:12.440
and what happens when you update a theme is,

57
00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:16.790
or a plugin is it overwrites itself with the new code.

58
00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:21.130
So, and it overwrites it wholesale, so we lost,

59
00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:24.070
in the parent theme, where we had called

60
00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:26.780
for the Typekit fonts, we lost that call.

61
00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:28.150
It was in the header or PHP,

62
00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:29.210
and I just forgot about it.

63
00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:30.960
I didn't, or I didn't notice it,

64
00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:32.510
so I didn't put it in the child theme.

65
00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:35.410
So I had to go back and add it to the child theme,

66
00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:40.410
and so the lesson is, if you find a theme that you like,

67
00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:45.330
in the Theme repository, and it's accessibility-ready,

68
00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:49.320
that's great, you can go ahead and use that theme,

69
00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:52.500
if you want, and you can use it as your base theme,

70
00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.130
but if you make modifications to it,

71
00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:58.070
or if you plan to, beyond just adding content

72
00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:00.670
in your WordPress database and changing,

73
00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:03.763
or customizing, making, you know, customized,

74
00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:07.150
customizing the variables that are in here,

75
00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:09.770
like if I change any of, say, you know,

76
00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:11.820
the colors, right, so I wanna do a prime,

77
00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:14.227
a different default primary color here

78
00:04:14.227 --> 00:04:19.227
for this, so I can change it from blue to a purplish color.

79
00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:22.253
So now, instead of blue, we see purple here.

80
00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:27.650
You know, you can make these little customizer modifications

81
00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:29.810
no problem in parent themes,

82
00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:33.750
but if you plan to do anything to the actual files,

83
00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:36.660
in your parent theme, then you absolutely need

84
00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:39.210
to use a child theme, and that way,

85
00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:42.210
you can make these changes in a nondestructive way,

86
00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:44.816
and those changes get preserved

87
00:04:44.816 --> 00:04:49.063
even if the parent theme updates itself.

88
00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:54.920
So the things that we have done in our theme

89
00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:59.090
are to call some additional helper files.

90
00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:03.090
I believe we're calling a JavaScript

91
00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:07.010
to provide some additional accessibility supports

92
00:05:08.537 --> 00:05:09.778
for the main menu,

93
00:05:09.778 --> 00:05:12.893
for when you open up the search,

94
00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:17.130
the search box, and I'll look for that,

95
00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:18.610
and see if I can find that

96
00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:20.310
and show you what that looks like.

97
00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:25.783
So let's see.

98
00:05:25.783 --> 00:05:28.593
We're having the Typekits, and then,

99
00:05:31.701 --> 00:05:34.280
we have jQuery coming in, because it's WordPress.

100
00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:35.113
Let's see.

101
00:05:36.632 --> 00:05:40.987
And I don't think, I don't think I have it here on this.

102
00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:48.850
Yeah.

103
00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:50.430
This probably doesn't have

104
00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:54.653
that JavaScript helper file in it on this page,

105
00:05:57.329 --> 00:05:59.290
but we've basically taken

106
00:06:01.756 --> 00:06:04.331
the accessible defaults of WordPress,

107
00:06:04.331 --> 00:06:06.930
using an accessibility-ready theme,

108
00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:09.490
and then, layered our own child theme on top of that,

109
00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:13.210
to create a more accessible and customized version

110
00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:14.973
of this theme for us,

111
00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:21.160
and that's what using a child theme on top

112
00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:23.510
of an accessibility-ready theme would give you.
