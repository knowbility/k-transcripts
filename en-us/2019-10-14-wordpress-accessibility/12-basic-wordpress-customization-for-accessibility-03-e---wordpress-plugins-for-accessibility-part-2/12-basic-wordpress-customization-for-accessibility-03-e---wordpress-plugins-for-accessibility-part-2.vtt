1
00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:03.010
<v Instructor>So, more plugins.</v>

2
00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:07.720
So, this is one that we had mentioned in the chat earlier.

3
00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:11.730
The WCAG 2.0 Form Fields for Gravity Forms.

4
00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:13.450
This is something that we actually

5
00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:16.740
use this plugin, or both of these plugins.

6
00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.110
We use Gravity Forms and then

7
00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:20.050
the WCAG 2.0 Form Fields

8
00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:21.180
for Gravity Forms

9
00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:24.800
on the air rally site.

10
00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.240
So

11
00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:28.700
this is a free plug in.

12
00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:30.600
Adrian Gordon is

13
00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.403
the author of this.

14
00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:36.900
And maintains this

15
00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:42.270
in a very proactive way.

16
00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:43.140
So

17
00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:45.390
as changes happen to

18
00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.390
both Wordpress and Gravity Forms,

19
00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:51.240
Adrian is kind enough to keep updating this.

20
00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:53.450
Now, the last update was four months ago.

21
00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:55.260
There may be some things that need some changing,

22
00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.681
but it works really, really well.

23
00:00:57.681 --> 00:01:00.390
So, that I would highly recommend

24
00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.273
if you're using Gravity Forms, on your site,

25
00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:06.670
Gravity Forms does a good job overall

26
00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:07.503
but you

27
00:01:09.778 --> 00:01:12.720
cannot ensure full accessability

28
00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.520
of your forms without using this plugin.

29
00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.190
And even then there may be some things

30
00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:19.893
you have to change or do manually.

31
00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:26.223
So Gravity Forms have a plugin to fix those.

32
00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:30.900
Contact Form 7, another very popular contact form.

33
00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.460
And there are accessible defaults by Joe Dolson.

34
00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:36.603
Hear his name again.

35
00:01:38.721 --> 00:01:41.350
This plugin fixes some of the issues

36
00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:45.000
related to Contact Form 7 fields.

37
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.840
And this was updated three months ago

38
00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.520
again Joe is graciously updating

39
00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.120
this plugin

40
00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:56.283
as Contact Form 7 and Wordpress changes.

41
00:01:57.836 --> 00:02:00.863
So those are great plugins to use.

42
00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:05.790
Genesis Accessible, so if you use the

43
00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.623
genesis theme framework, Rian,

44
00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:13.300
from the Wordpress accessibility team,

45
00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.880
I think she, after the Gutenberg debacle,

46
00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.710
has stepped back a little bit

47
00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:21.060
from that,

48
00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.380
but she's a great resource for accessability

49
00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:24.650
based out of Europe

50
00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:29.030
and has created the Genesis Accessible plugin

51
00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:31.880
so that you can make genesis themes

52
00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:34.820
more accessible in Wordpress.

53
00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:38.450
This has been tested up to 5.2.2

54
00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:41.063
and was updated three months ago as well.

55
00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.900
The genesis theme framework has done a great job

56
00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:48.440
with addressing accessibility issues inside of it.

57
00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.890
They have people at StudioPress,

58
00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:53.220
they're very interested in accessibility,

59
00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:57.340
so I expect to see more good things from them

60
00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:00.140
in the future as they continue

61
00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:02.453
creating themes

62
00:03:02.453 --> 00:03:05.513
and making updates to their framework.

63
00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:08.930
But that's not the only framework, right?

64
00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:11.150
So there's a

65
00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:13.810
very popular theme called Divi.

66
00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:16.130
So CampusPress has created

67
00:03:18.313 --> 00:03:19.146
a plugin

68
00:03:19.146 --> 00:03:22.030
to address accessibility concerns

69
00:03:23.088 --> 00:03:23.921
with Divi.

70
00:03:23.921 --> 00:03:26.650
So Divi can be

71
00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:28.680
highly dynamic in terms of

72
00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.640
how you build a theme,

73
00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:33.630
or how you build a site using that theme.

74
00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:37.963
And it has a number of JavaScript powered

75
00:03:37.963 --> 00:03:38.796
items

76
00:03:38.796 --> 00:03:42.580
like accordions and

77
00:03:45.954 --> 00:03:47.699
different menu options

78
00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:51.230
that get fixed with this particular plugin.

79
00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:53.320
Now this was last updated six months ago

80
00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:56.850
and it was tested up to 5.0.4.

81
00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:01.360
I haven't heard any rumblings out of Elegant Themes,

82
00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:05.780
who make Divi, about them addressing accessibility

83
00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:09.061
proactively within the Divi theme itself

84
00:04:09.061 --> 00:04:12.602
or their framework, but it's always good

85
00:04:12.602 --> 00:04:15.190
to push for that and to say hey,

86
00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:17.600
look at this accessibility plugin,

87
00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:20.100
can you start incorporating some of the things

88
00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:23.410
that this fixes into your themes and think

89
00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:25.410
about accessibility proactively,

90
00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:28.140
because there are a number of people

91
00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:30.940
that really, really, love Divi

92
00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:34.070
and I cringe because I have tried to build sites

93
00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:37.112
with Divi and to build them accessibly

94
00:04:37.112 --> 00:04:39.610
is a very difficult task.

95
00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:41.360
So this plugin helps with that,

96
00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:44.190
but because it's very popular, people like it

97
00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:47.050
because there are certain ease of use

98
00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:50.520
for non-technical website authors or builders

99
00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:54.260
that you can really benefit from having

100
00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:56.783
accessibility baked into it, something like Divi.

101
00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:04.670
Let's get into some plugins that just have

102
00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:06.100
accessibility baked into them.

103
00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:11.100
So Joe Dolson, surprise, built a My Calendar plugin.

104
00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:14.885
So this is an events calendar plugin for Wordpress

105
00:05:14.885 --> 00:05:18.610
that allows accessibility out of the box.

106
00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:20.683
It has accessible defaults.

107
00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:22.960
He also has

108
00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:26.720
a My Tickets plugin

109
00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:30.230
that can work with My Calendar so

110
00:05:32.831 --> 00:05:36.710
you can rest assured that his plugin

111
00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:41.073
works accessibly out of the box, so to speak.

112
00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:47.470
There is the Soliloquy Slider.

113
00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:51.500
So this is a plugin for carousels

114
00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:56.500
and I learned about this from a former colleague of mine,

115
00:05:56.730 --> 00:05:58.793
Bobby Brooks here at Nobility.

116
00:06:01.015 --> 00:06:03.290
He did a lot of Wordpress training

117
00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:08.560
with our clients but also at AccessU,

118
00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:11.950
our conference on web accessibility every year in Austin.

119
00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:14.020
And Bobby

120
00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:16.550
knew

121
00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:17.770
something that I didn't

122
00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:22.770
which is that if you had to build a carousel in Wordpress,

123
00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:26.830
and you needed to make it accessible,

124
00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:29.500
that Soliloquy would allow you to do that.

125
00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:30.980
It's not that,

126
00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:32.750
not that it will

127
00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:34.020
force you to do that.

128
00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:35.700
You can make a very inaccessible

129
00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:38.630
carousel experience using Soliloquy,

130
00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:42.683
but if you care about accessibility,

131
00:06:44.227 --> 00:06:47.270
you can customize the interface

132
00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:53.340
using the Soliloquy slider theme options within it.

133
00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:57.340
And you can make a very accessible carousel interface.

134
00:06:57.340 --> 00:06:58.200
I would argue

135
00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:01.690
in most instances

136
00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:05.100
you may not need a carousel for your site,

137
00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:07.920
but there are certain use cases

138
00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:09.900
where carousels do make sense

139
00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:12.330
and certainly product sliders

140
00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:15.480
where you're sliding across images, things like that,

141
00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:18.010
a soliloquy slider might be the answer

142
00:07:18.010 --> 00:07:19.810
if you need to make that accessible.

143
00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:25.540
So that's one that has accessibility support

144
00:07:27.832 --> 00:07:28.665
that you can,

145
00:07:30.130 --> 00:07:31.990
use within it.

146
00:07:31.990 --> 00:07:36.080
And then the other one is this NextGen image gallery.

147
00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:37.750
So the NextGen image gallery

148
00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:42.010
also allows you to customize it

149
00:07:42.010 --> 00:07:46.140
and ensure that it is accessible.

150
00:07:46.140 --> 00:07:48.000
You can make a very inaccessible

151
00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:49.713
image gallery with it as well.

152
00:07:51.470 --> 00:07:53.023
And they also have pro,

153
00:07:54.750 --> 00:07:55.980
premium plugin

154
00:07:57.540 --> 00:07:59.453
plugin options with features.
