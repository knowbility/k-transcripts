1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:03,360
- [Instructor] So, you
can find me on LinkedIn.

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:07,650
I quit Facebook and Twitter a while back.

3
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:10,120
So I've remained on LinkedIn.

4
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:11,600
I'm under iamjolly,

5
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:14,400
or you can just Google
Robert Jolly, Knowbility

6
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:17,930
and you can find me there.

7
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:21,460
I'd be happy to answer any
follow-up questions there

8
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:26,460
as well as if you want to
ask questions over Twitter,

9
00:00:26,658 --> 00:00:30,120
or Facebook @knowbility, if you just say,

10
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:33,020
I'm asking for Robert to chime in on this,

11
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:34,350
what do you think about this?

12
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:36,210
Then I'd be happy to get
back in touch with you

13
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:39,330
through those channels through Knowbility.

14
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:42,170
So, tea for teaching is one that

15
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:45,690
that Rebecca had

16
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:49,330
had asked about.

17
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:50,780
So the first thing I do when I

18
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:54,130
load up a page, besides just
visually scanning the page,

19
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:55,970
is to just start hitting Tab.

20
00:00:55,970 --> 00:00:58,460
So I'm hitting Tab and,

21
00:00:58,460 --> 00:00:59,293
where am I?

22
00:00:59,293 --> 00:01:00,207
Let's see.

23
00:01:00,207 --> 00:01:01,040
Oh, there we go.

24
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:02,220
Skip to content.

25
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:03,263
Then Home,

26
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:07,260
Episodes didn't get, okay.

27
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:09,130
I don't know if you can see on my screen,

28
00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:14,130
but I'm in the tags, or the
categories, for this posted in

29
00:01:16,527 --> 00:01:17,360
section.

30
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:22,040
So looking at the focus
outline, I would like for that

31
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:24,253
to be stronger, for me.

32
00:01:25,610 --> 00:01:29,410
It's also maybe the text size that's

33
00:01:29,410 --> 00:01:31,810
that's getting me a little bit there.

34
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:32,643
And then,

35
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:34,333
here we have

36
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:38,440
I'm in the podcast player interface

37
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:40,850
which it looks like I can get to

38
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:43,480
most all of the controls, although,

39
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:45,210
I don't know when I'm on the Play control.

40
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:47,040
I think I'm on it now,
so I'm gonna hit the

41
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,980
spacebar to see if I'm on
that button, yes, I am.

42
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:51,162
- [Video] The student population...

43
00:01:51,162 --> 00:01:53,660
- [Instructor] So I just
hit the button again.

44
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:56,210
So this doesn't have visible focus on it.

45
00:01:56,210 --> 00:01:58,150
It will hover, and I
can see it turn green,

46
00:01:58,150 --> 00:02:01,154
so I would maybe just add a style to that,

47
00:02:01,154 --> 00:02:03,870
if you're able to control
the styles on these.

48
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:07,910
Adding a style to allow the focus state

49
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:09,220
to match the hover state would be

50
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:10,570
something I would do there.

51
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:13,960
It's great that you
have a transcript there,

52
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:16,900
and that just reveals it here.

53
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:19,510
Not sure if that is
revealed accessibly or not,

54
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:20,830
so I'm gonna look at it.

55
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:25,320
I'm just going to Inspect
very quickly and see

56
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,180
so

57
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,570
this is giving a

58
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:32,933
all right, so that's a list item,

59
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:36,830
and it says it's already
expanded equals false,

60
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:41,670
but then the anchor is
what I'm clicking on

61
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:43,770
and it has a role of
presentation so I'm not,

62
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:45,590
and it says Transcript.

63
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:47,890
But it has a role of
presentation so I'm not sure

64
00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:49,210
if that gets announced out.

65
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:51,270
I would be concerned
about that, but I would

66
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:52,930
want to check that with the screen reader.

67
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:56,530
I'm not gonna fire that
open right now to do that,

68
00:02:56,530 --> 00:03:00,500
but I can take a look
at this, and this says

69
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:02,010
you know, the name is Transcript,

70
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:04,010
the role is

71
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:07,770
it says it's the role of
a link here, even though

72
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:12,290
it's not, but maybe that's
because the container around it

73
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:13,690
has a tab index of zero,

74
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:15,430
this list item container.

75
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:17,910
So this is probably

76
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:19,740
from a plugin, is what I'm guessing,

77
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:20,573
because this,

78
00:03:20,573 --> 00:03:23,060
this list item has been made focusable

79
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:26,880
and been given a role of a tab, on that.

80
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:29,240
So I would also, yeah,

81
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:33,930
tab and expanded is not a
thing, that I'm aware of,

82
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:38,530
so that would be something
I would want to revisit

83
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:41,430
a little bit with whatever plugin that is.

84
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:42,950
It may announce out fine,

85
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:43,783
with a screen reader,

86
00:03:43,783 --> 00:03:45,050
but I would

87
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:49,390
I would say this is probably
gonna find a couple of issues

88
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:50,550
if I run fastpass

89
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,073
with that particular tab.

90
00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:55,960
So let's see what happens here.

91
00:03:57,970 --> 00:03:59,940
But keyboard navigation looks really good

92
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:02,020
overall with that.

93
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:05,340
No failures detected,
so that's really good.

94
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:07,990
Some of the stuff that
maybe I was suspecting

95
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:10,760
and would have verified
with a screen reader,

96
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:14,130
it may have passed this automated check.

97
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:16,483
So that's tea for teaching.

98
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,950
Looks like I've got one

99
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:23,500
I'm gonna take the notary compliance,

100
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:26,890
Secretary of State, Texas dot gov.

101
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:29,633
So Texas Notary Public Compliance.

102
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:33,360
So this is an online training system.

103
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,870
And I'm just gonna do my
thing where I hit Tab.

104
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:38,330
I don't know where I am

105
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:40,240
because there's no visible tab focus here.

106
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,140
So that is something I would change.

107
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:45,660
Now I can just for my testing edification,

108
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:48,230
I can force tab focus.

109
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:49,330
Now I am

110
00:04:50,463 --> 00:04:53,900
I am not, okay, so maybe,
yeah, let's see here,

111
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:56,700
now I can see where I am, at least.

112
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:57,873
Can I get to?

113
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,730
So I can't activate this menu here,

114
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:03,070
that apparently I can with a mouse,

115
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:05,120
so I can't activate the "Need Help" menu.

116
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:10,190
That would be, that needs
a little help, there.

117
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:12,200
So I can mouse over it
and it will show up,

118
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:16,870
but I can't activate it
with a keyboard alone.

119
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:19,360
And I can't go to that
link, either, directly,

120
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,180
so there's no way for me
to get to this content

121
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:24,030
or these pages

122
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:27,120
with that, so that would be
something that I would look for.

123
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,410
I'm not sure if there's a skip link,

124
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:30,140
doesn't seem like there is,

125
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:31,810
so I would want one on a site like this,

126
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:35,103
because you have a number of
repeated navigation items here.

127
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:41,840
This text may be too low of contrast,

128
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,910
just based on my glancing at it.

129
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:45,510
It's, it might be fine, though,

130
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:48,180
it just looks very light on my screen.

131
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:51,360
So it's 555, which is a dark gray,

132
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,350
against a lighter gray color,

133
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:55,290
so we're gonna test that right now,

134
00:05:55,290 --> 00:06:00,290
and it's 4.98, so it does
pass the 4.5 to 1 ratio.

135
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:03,150
It's just, maybe a little light.

136
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:07,363
So you could, since you're a state agency

137
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:12,460
that you don't know who is coming to this

138
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:15,040
you know, obviously, notary publics can be

139
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:18,033
from all walks of life,

140
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,820
and you will have people who are

141
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:25,100
of different age, and of
different computer ability.

142
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:28,050
Making sure that this text
is as legible as possible

143
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:31,750
is probably quite important.

144
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:33,670
Because you have some
instructions here where

145
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:36,600
there are two steps,
first you must do this,

146
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,263
second you must do this,

147
00:06:39,752 --> 00:06:42,670
and, you know, and then
you have some stuff about

148
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:44,670
you know, logging in and scoring.

149
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:47,140
This is really important
content, so I would,

150
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:49,120
I would argue that

151
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:54,090
make this text both bigger and

152
00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:56,650
and darker, potentially.

153
00:06:56,650 --> 00:07:00,550
So I'm gonna go with
just a plain black text,

154
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:03,660
and then I'm gonna change its font size

155
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:06,010
to

156
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:14,570
3rem, oh, that's too big.

157
00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:17,870
That's downright bad, but you can see

158
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:19,500
I'm just changing some
stuff in the browser,

159
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:22,470
and I'm looking at things from

160
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:23,680
the perspective of

161
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:26,350
what's going to make this
accessible for people

162
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:30,990
even if it passes the WCAG guidelines?

163
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:34,090
Technically, what can make
it even better for folks?

164
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:36,420
And, you know, those are
the things that I would do

165
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:37,993
based on just that one home page.

166
00:07:37,993 --> 00:07:41,080
Just look at that menu, change

167
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:43,260
change the way that this menu works,

168
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:46,260
there's probably a responsive
menu in here somewhere as well

169
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:50,020
that might need to be changed,

170
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:50,853
looked at.

171
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:54,910
I imagine if I change the size,

172
00:07:54,910 --> 00:07:57,160
yeah, it goes to this

173
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:59,363
navigation there, and I wonder if that,

174
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:04,050
yeah, that opens up, but then,

175
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:06,223
oh, here we go, okay,
I can tab through it.

176
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:08,700
Can I close it with the escape?

177
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:10,020
No, but,

178
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:11,070
can I get to that?

179
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:13,050
I can't get to the close button, either

180
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:15,000
with the keyboard, it looks like.

181
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:15,833
Oh, wait, no, I can.

182
00:08:15,833 --> 00:08:16,670
It's at the bottom.

183
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:18,630
So this is one where that order is,

184
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:19,780
it's out of order.

185
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:21,720
So this x button is up at the top left,

186
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:24,730
which I would expect to be
first in the source order,

187
00:08:24,730 --> 00:08:28,400
in relation to this home button and also

188
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,423
all of these navigation links,

189
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:34,190
but it's the last thing on the page,

190
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:35,850
and then it's somehow

191
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:37,660
placed at the top,

192
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:39,040
using CSS.

193
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:42,200
So I would change that, I think.

194
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,830
And then when this is open,

195
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:46,830
I wouldn't want to move
people outside of this.

196
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:49,670
This would be like a modal,
so I would trap people's focus

197
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:52,920
in here until they explicitly close that,

198
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:56,063
and then take them back
to this button up here.

199
00:08:57,090 --> 00:08:59,770
So that would be another item where,

200
00:08:59,770 --> 00:09:01,543
controlling where you are,

201
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:05,040
you know, making sure that
it makes sense for folks,

202
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,540
would be something I would do.

203
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:14,330
And so how do I force tab
focus, was a question.

204
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,030
I have a bookmarklet.

205
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:19,010
So there are accessibility
testing bookmarklets

206
00:09:19,010 --> 00:09:21,580
that you can get, and

207
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:24,030
I'll be sure to add a link to it

208
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:28,470
in a resources slide, as
well, for later distribution,

209
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:29,303
but this,

210
00:09:29,303 --> 00:09:30,136
I have two of them.

211
00:09:30,136 --> 00:09:32,250
I have a focus bookmarklet and, I think,

212
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:35,440
force or show tab focus, but,

213
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:40,120
but these will basically override
something on a page where

214
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:44,000
where someone has removed
visible focus but I wanna see it

215
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,030
then I can use that to get around a page

216
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:49,960
by forcing to show the tab focus.

217
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,570
Now I have it in there twice,

218
00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:53,760
so two orange bars

219
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,490
around these.

220
00:09:55,490 --> 00:09:56,793
So I got double focus.

221
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,990
All right, so captioning is about to end,

222
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:03,040
in just a few minutes,

223
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:07,320
so I wanna take a look
at the c-hear dot com.

224
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:12,320
So here we have some stuff
coming up on the page.

225
00:10:12,650 --> 00:10:16,810
So let's take a look.

226
00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:18,830
So I'm hitting tab and

227
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:20,120
oh, wait, let's see,

228
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,040
here, I'm hitting tab.

229
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:25,363
All right, so I've got, all right.

230
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:30,060
Got some stuff going on here.

231
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:32,070
Let's see, I'm gonna
just refresh the page,

232
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:33,673
and then I'm gonna start tabbing.

233
00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:37,690
So skip to content is the
first link, that's great.

234
00:10:37,690 --> 00:10:40,810
Then we have an
accessibility tools item that

235
00:10:40,810 --> 00:10:42,970
animates open, and so it's a widget,

236
00:10:42,970 --> 00:10:46,470
and I can increase the
text, decrease the text,

237
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:50,010
do stuff with contrast,
do stuff with links,

238
00:10:50,010 --> 00:10:52,670
and fonts, and reset the settings.

239
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:54,570
So that's cool.

240
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:57,640
Let's see, hit escape, I
can't close that with escape.

241
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:59,400
I'd want to be able to do that.

242
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:03,270
And then there's an
icon with a wheelchair,

243
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:06,190
so I'm, I guess that
closes it and opens it,

244
00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:07,993
so that toggles it opens and closed.

245
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:10,380
So that's

246
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:11,250
should be fine.

247
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:12,830
Skip to content, and there's a,

248
00:11:12,830 --> 00:11:14,410
there's something that
takes focus up here,

249
00:11:14,410 --> 00:11:16,160
I don't know what it is,

250
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,790
but it takes focus.

251
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:19,440
It looks like it's a mailto link.

252
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:24,180
I would want that, if
that is something that

253
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:27,610
needs to happen, needs to be visible,

254
00:11:27,610 --> 00:11:30,990
if it's in the tab index
then I would make it visible

255
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:33,083
for folks, as well.

256
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:38,500
The focus outline is red on blue.

257
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:42,240
That is probably okay, I'd
wanna check the contrast of that

258
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,390
just to make sure you're
having really good contrast

259
00:11:44,390 --> 00:11:45,570
for those.

260
00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:47,740
Also, you have some hover states

261
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:50,080
that are really nice.

262
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:52,070
They kind of animate in,

263
00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:55,800
so the background on the menu changes from

264
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:58,075
grayish blue, like a gunmetal gray,

265
00:11:58,075 --> 00:12:02,290
to a black background,
when I hover over them,

266
00:12:02,290 --> 00:12:04,770
but all I get when I'm tabbing

267
00:12:04,770 --> 00:12:06,300
is just a red outline.

268
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:07,370
So I would,

269
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:08,960
I would keep the red outline,

270
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:12,510
but I would do that thing that
you do with the hover states

271
00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:14,840
for the focus, to make
them more consistent,

272
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:17,070
but also more obvious for people who

273
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:18,350
who have low vision.

274
00:12:18,350 --> 00:12:20,210
Because that little red outline

275
00:12:20,210 --> 00:12:22,870
just might not be bold
enough for some folks.

276
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:25,343
But I can get to all the links there.

277
00:12:26,477 --> 00:12:27,930
Looks like you have a
YouTube video embedded.

278
00:12:27,930 --> 00:12:30,030
I'm not gonna test that,
but you have read more links

279
00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:31,750
and I'd be interested to see,

280
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:33,170
hopefully those are

281
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:37,180
in good context, so I'm
gonna inspect them right now,

282
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:38,480
and

283
00:12:39,470 --> 00:12:40,620
see what we have,

284
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:44,200
so all of this looks like
it may be in all a link.

285
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,363
Is that all in a link?

286
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:50,173
No, okay, so let's go to read more.

287
00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:55,040
Lot of divs here.

288
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,233
So there's a div,

289
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:00,260
read more, and then there's some

290
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:02,593
generated content before and after.

291
00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:10,170
That's interesting.

292
00:13:10,170 --> 00:13:12,640
Yeah, I'm not sure how this
would look in a list of links.

293
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:14,960
So that would be something
that I would wanna know,

294
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:17,938
like, that these are clearly related to

295
00:13:17,938 --> 00:13:20,740
disability, education, medical, legal,

296
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:24,710
when you pull up, say, a list
of links in a screen reader.

297
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:26,580
That would be something
in the learn mores,

298
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:27,993
the same thing with those.

299
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:32,240
Then we've got a form here.

300
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,740
Forms are always fun.

301
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:37,383
These have very low contrast
placeholder text in them.

302
00:13:38,430 --> 00:13:41,380
And if I type in them, the
placeholder text goes away,

303
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:42,650
so I have to remember,

304
00:13:42,650 --> 00:13:44,840
and if I have a cognitive
disability, that,

305
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,310
I might not remember what this is.

306
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:47,470
Like, was that industry?

307
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:49,520
Or was that business that I
just typed in, I don't know.

308
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:51,423
I have to clear out my,

309
00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:53,360
my information.

310
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,210
So let me see.

311
00:13:54,210 --> 00:13:55,693
I hit the wrong button there.

312
00:13:56,700 --> 00:14:01,520
So one thing I'd wanna check
is the form accessibility here

313
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:02,353
on these.

314
00:14:02,353 --> 00:14:05,060
Are these labeled appropriately?

315
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:07,410
They do have placeholder text,

316
00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:09,610
but do they have a label on them?

317
00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:12,240
So I see aria required equals true.

318
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:17,170
It is using gravity forms
and it is labeled and

319
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,390
oh, wait, the label is

320
00:14:22,610 --> 00:14:23,443
empty.

321
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:26,560
Oops.

322
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,203
So that might be a problem.

323
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:33,883
I would wanna check this out
in the accessibility inspector.

324
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:38,660
So it says, name, first name,
and it's pulling the label

325
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:41,230
from the placeholder, which is unreliable.

326
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:46,230
So it doesn't get a label
from the actual label,

327
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:48,690
it doesn't get it from an aria label,

328
00:14:48,690 --> 00:14:50,750
it just gets it from the placeholder.

329
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:52,240
So

330
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:55,530
this would probably be,

331
00:14:55,530 --> 00:14:57,560
I think this would get flagged by a,

332
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:59,280
an automated checker.

333
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:00,793
But let me look and see.

334
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:05,720
All right, and we're
gonna wrap up after this.

335
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,183
So these,

336
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,740
these didn't pick up
those label issues that

337
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:18,660
I was picking up,

338
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:20,130
so those may be fine.

339
00:15:20,130 --> 00:15:22,130
I would wanna check that
with the system technology,

340
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:22,963
though,

341
00:15:22,963 --> 00:15:24,280
make sure that form works well,

342
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:28,790
but placeholders alone
can be pretty problematic,

343
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:31,400
so I would recommend not doing that.

344
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,460
Oh, I know why this didn't check.

345
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:36,000
This caught the labels, but
they have asterisks for them,

346
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:36,833
so they're not,

347
00:15:36,833 --> 00:15:39,490
they're labeled but they
don't have any meaningful text

348
00:15:39,490 --> 00:15:40,323
in them.

349
00:15:40,323 --> 00:15:42,660
So that would be something
that I would want to

350
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:43,540
do more about.

351
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:46,810
So thank you, everyone,
for joining me today.

352
00:15:46,810 --> 00:15:50,270
I hope that the WordPress
information was relevant

353
00:15:50,270 --> 00:15:52,066
and helpful for you.

354
00:15:52,066 --> 00:15:54,400
Please do let me know

355
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:55,233
what

356
00:15:56,890 --> 00:15:58,640
what questions you have ongoing,

357
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:01,020
and we will make sure that we get

358
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:06,020
links to the deck as well
as access to the video

359
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:07,513
for today's session.
