00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.100
<v ->We talked a little bit about built-in helper functions</v>

2
00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:06.950
and classes but this is something worth going over again.

3
00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:09.510
In CSS, we have WordPress

4
00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.570
ships with the screen-reader-text class.

5
00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.110
So, take advantage of that.

6
00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:19.110
The screen-reader-text class will hide text visibly

7
00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:24.540
on the page and so that augments say links

8
00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.750
or other pieces of content with accessible names or labels,

9
00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:35.230
so we saw that in our AirAlly site

10
00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:40.230
with the Facebook and Twitter logo, those links,

11
00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.610
they had the screen-reader-text that was being used.

12
00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:47.560
There's whole documentation over here

13
00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:49.266
and on the WordPress handbook

14
00:00:49.266 --> 00:00:52.670
on the class for screen-reader-text.

15
00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:54.413
What it does and how to use it.

16
00:00:55.721 --> 00:00:59.210
And it was first introduced way back, a decade ago 2009.

17
00:01:03.313 --> 00:01:08.290
It is still around and it's one that a lot of developers

18
00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:12.440
aren't familiar with or don't know about.

19
00:01:14.047 --> 00:01:15.740
If you don't do development yourself,

20
00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:17.810
but you work with WordPress developers,

21
00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:21.180
this would be something really cool to clue them in on,

22
00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.605
if they don't already know about it.

23
00:01:23.605 --> 00:01:27.416
This gives you the code of what's in it,

24
00:01:27.416 --> 00:01:30.723
you don't have to write this code, this is already baked in.

25
00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:35.940
This gives you the code for when something receives focus

26
00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:39.653
like those keyboard shortcuts or the skip navigation links.

27
00:01:41.968 --> 00:01:45.969
And then here's an example of that,

28
00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:48.169
what does that look like, what does that do?

29
00:01:49.058 --> 00:01:53.150
That's something to take advantage of.

30
00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:57.170
And then increasingly, our WordPress sites

31
00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:01.663
are becoming highly interactive and powered by JavaScript.

32
00:02:02.863 --> 00:02:07.863
Matt Mullenweg at the 2015 WordCamp US in Philadelphia,

33
00:02:08.875 --> 00:02:13.875
his closing keynote said, his main message was,

34
00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.540
learn JavaScript deeply.

35
00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:22.540
And we see that, in fact, WordPress is moving toward more

36
00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:25.390
JavaScript powered interactions

37
00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:27.420
especially with the Gutenberg editor.

38
00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:30.550
And you can run JavaScript

39
00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:33.600
as your front-end

40
00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:38.370
for your WordPress site and hook into WordPress

41
00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:41.560
and it's database and it's different functions

42
00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:44.913
to power things via JavaScript using the API.

43
00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:51.210
With JavaScript, we have a method called wp.a11y.speak

44
00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:56.950
and what that does is, it populates an ARIA live region

45
00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:02.530
with information that you would want to have announced

46
00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:06.020
for assisted technology users.

47
00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:08.810
Like screen readers will announce an ARIA live region

48
00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:11.160
and anything that's changed in there.

49
00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:15.250
This speak method lets you tap into that.

50
00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:19.036
If you are say updating dynamically

51
00:03:19.036 --> 00:03:24.036
the results of your listings on a page,

52
00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:29.060
say you run a university website

53
00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:32.280
and you have a staff directory or a faculty directory.

54
00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.560
And you have filter options,

55
00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:37.010
I wanna see everyone in the biology department

56
00:03:38.548 --> 00:03:43.190
or the ceramics department, and so you have a list of say,

57
00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:48.190
75 faculty members that then updates to 14 faculty members

58
00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:51.400
in the biology department.

59
00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.850
Then that updates dynamically

60
00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:55.820
and maybe the page hasn't changed

61
00:03:55.820 --> 00:04:00.590
but you can populate this wp.a11y.speak method

62
00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:05.130
using JavaScript when your JavaScript fires

63
00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:07.781
to change the results on the page, you can also say,

64
00:04:07.781 --> 00:04:12.220
now showing 14 of 75 faculty members

65
00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:13.440
in the biology department.

66
00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:14.840
And it would speak that out.

67
00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:20.540
There are examples of this and also the code,

68
00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:25.540
very similarly to the screen-reader-text information.

69
00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:32.670
And then there's a demo site that Sammy

70
00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:37.670
from the WordPress core team had put out there.

71
00:04:41.586 --> 00:04:43.886
I think this is a presentation, but let's see.

72
00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:48.880
Yeah, so there is an example of this as well.

73
00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:52.280
So, we can go back to this after we break

74
00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:55.423
and we can check out what that does.

75
00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:01.280
Because this is really cool

76
00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:02.980
that this is built-in to WordPress

77
00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:04.510
and you can take advantage of that.

78
00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:06.090
So, you don't have to shy away from

79
00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:09.400
some of the advanced features of WordPress

80
00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:12.500
or of web design and development,

81
00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:16.070
some of these new technologies, new frameworks,

82
00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:19.810
you wanna have an Angular front-end or a React front-end

83
00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:21.270
to your WordPress site

84
00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:26.210
and you want it to be highly dynamic and cutting-edge.

85
00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:28.913
You can do that and you can make it accessible too.

86
00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:34.990
Don't shy away from the advanced development techniques.
