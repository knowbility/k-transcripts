- We talked a little bit about built-in helper functions and classes but this is something worth going over again. In CSS, we have WordPress ships with the screen-reader-text class. So, take advantage of that. The screen-reader-text class will hide text visibly on the page and so that augments say links or other pieces of content with accessible names or labels, so we saw that in our AirAlly site with the Facebook and Twitter logo, those links, they had the screen-reader-text that was being used. There's whole documentation over here and on the WordPress handbook on the class for screen-reader-text. What it does and how to use it. And it was first introduced way back, a decade ago 2009. It is still around and it's one that a lot of developers aren't familiar with or don't know about. If you don't do development yourself, but you work with WordPress developers, this would be something really cool to clue them in on, if they don't already know about it. This gives you the code of what's in it, you don't have to write this code, this is already baked in. This gives you the code for when something receives focus like those keyboard shortcuts or the skip navigation links. And then here's an example of that, what does that look like, what does that do? That's something to take advantage of. And then increasingly, our WordPress sites are becoming highly interactive and powered by JavaScript. Matt Mullenweg at the 2015 WordCamp US in Philadelphia, his closing keynote said, his main message was, learn JavaScript deeply. And we see that, in fact, WordPress is moving toward more JavaScript powered interactions especially with the Gutenberg editor. And you can run JavaScript as your front-end for your WordPress site and hook into WordPress and it's database and it's different functions to power things via JavaScript using the API. With JavaScript, we have a method called wp.a11y.speak and what that does is, it populates an ARIA live region with information that you would want to have announced for assisted technology users. Like screen readers will announce an ARIA live region and anything that's changed in there. This speak method lets you tap into that. If you are say updating dynamically the results of your listings on a page, say you run a university website and you have a staff directory or a faculty directory. And you have filter options, I wanna see everyone in the biology department or the ceramics department, and so you have a list of say, 75 faculty members that then updates to 14 faculty members in the biology department. Then that updates dynamically and maybe the page hasn't changed but you can populate this wp.a11y.speak method using JavaScript when your JavaScript fires to change the results on the page, you can also say, now showing 14 of 75 faculty members in the biology department. And it would speak that out. There are examples of this and also the code, very similarly to the screen-reader-text information. And then there's a demo site that Sammy from the WordPress core team had put out there. I think this is a presentation, but let's see. Yeah, so there is an example of this as well. So, we can go back to this after we break and we can check out what that does. Because this is really cool that this is built-in to WordPress and you can take advantage of that. So, you don't have to shy away from some of the advanced features of WordPress or of web design and development, some of these new technologies, new frameworks, you wanna have an Angular front-end or a React front-end to your WordPress site and you want it to be highly dynamic and cutting-edge. You can do that and you can make it accessible too. Don't shy away from the advanced development techniques.
