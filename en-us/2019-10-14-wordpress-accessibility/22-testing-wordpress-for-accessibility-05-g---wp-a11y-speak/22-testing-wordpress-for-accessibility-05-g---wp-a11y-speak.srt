1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:02,730
- [Instructor] So this is
the demo page that Sammy

2
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:06,510
from the WordPress core team had posted.

3
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:08,570
So let's see what happens here.

4
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:11,567
So I'm just going to use my tab.

5
00:00:11,567 --> 00:00:12,700
- [Computer Generated Voice]
Kuorinka, Select City,

6
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:14,860
pop up button, menu five
items, check mark, Helsinki,

7
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:17,180
Kuopio, you are currently on a menu item.

8
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:19,330
To choose this menu item,
press control, option, space.

9
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:21,770
Press Kuopio, Kuopio,
select city, pop up button.

10
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:23,640
Filtering contacts was successful.

11
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:25,900
You are currently on a popup button.

12
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:28,130
- [Instructor] So filtering
contents was successful.

13
00:00:28,130 --> 00:00:31,429
No where on the page does that say this

14
00:00:31,429 --> 00:00:33,943
in visible text, right?

15
00:00:34,881 --> 00:00:38,500
It is just something that was spoken.

16
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:43,500
So that is an example of
how that ARIA live region

17
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:48,220
was populated using the
WP.A11y.speak method

18
00:00:53,929 --> 00:00:58,929
in JavaScript to basically
filter out that information.

19
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:02,800
So let's see if there's
another thing we can do.

20
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,300
So let's see.
- Accessibility.

21
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:06,740
Select menu six, up code, money, music,

22
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:09,680
closing menu, filtering
categories was successful.

23
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:10,940
You are currently on a pop up button.

24
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:12,630
To display--
- So there we go.

25
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:16,770
I filtered y category and it
also announced it, as well.

26
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:21,770
So that was very, very
interesting how that works.

27
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:25,282
So with this GABnow site,

28
00:01:25,282 --> 00:01:28,302
they could--
- Voiceover off.

29
00:01:28,302 --> 00:01:31,203
- [Instructor] Start
using a framework to do,

30
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:34,740
well this is a full page reload.

31
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:38,580
But if they were doing a
framework to update information,

32
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:42,023
then they could use that speak method.

33
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:45,000
Here, here's the accordions.

34
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,940
Let's see if these are accessible here.

35
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:48,860
'Cause these I know they're accordions

36
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:52,423
because I can look at job
descriptions under each,

37
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:54,780
each heading here.

38
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:58,293
So let's see first if they
are accessible via keyboard.

39
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,293
Let's see.

40
00:02:02,786 --> 00:02:04,140
Oh, I got it to apply now.

41
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:05,193
It doesn't look like,

42
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:09,580
back tabbing through all these items.

43
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:12,450
Yeah, all I can get to are form fields,

44
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:16,080
and these items right here don't seem

45
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,120
to be keyboard accessible at all.

46
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:23,120
So that's a flag that
I would throw up here.

47
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:25,480
But then the other one
would be just to see

48
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:29,303
what happens with voiceover.

- Notice,

54
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:43,110
there's no skip link here, as well.

55
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:46,020
So no way to skip all of
these navigation items.

56
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:49,570
I just have to go through
them or jump to the region,

57
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:51,550
which I'll go ahead and
do because I don't--

00:03:04,163 --> 00:03:05,450
the following internships available.

Down pointing black pointer, accounting.

69
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,000
You are currently on heading level six.

70
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,250
Inside of web content.

71
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:12,570
To exit this web area, press control,

72
00:03:12,570 --> 00:03:13,770
option, shift, up arrow.

73
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:17,000
- [Instructor] So it just tells me that

74
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,700
I'm on a heading level
six, but it doesn't tell me

75
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,030
that I can do anything with that.

76
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:24,164
It does say downward pointing black arrow.

77
00:03:24,164 --> 00:03:26,250
On my screen, it's actually green,

78
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:28,550
but that's the icon that they're using.

79
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:33,010
It does have for the
symbol that they're using.

80
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:37,470
And so Safari and voiceover
know enough about this

81
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:42,250
to say, okay I think that's a
downward pointing black arrow.

82
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:45,070
But I'm gonna try to click this area

83
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:47,667
with a control, option, space.

84
00:03:47,667 --> 00:03:48,810
- [Computer Generated Voice] Accounting.

85
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:50,240
You are currently on a
text element, inside,

86
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,780
down pointing black pointer.

87
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:53,292
You are currently on a text element, in--

88
00:03:53,292 --> 00:03:56,810
- [Instructor] So now it still
says down point black arrow,

89
00:03:56,810 --> 00:03:59,160
but the arrow is pointing up.

90
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:01,310
Also, that whole area expanded.

91
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:04,028
So what I would be expecting
for an accordion control

92
00:04:04,028 --> 00:04:06,530
as a screen reader user would be to know

93
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:09,668
that something was collapsed
and that it's clickable,

94
00:04:09,668 --> 00:04:12,920
and--
- Karen Creps to everyone,

95
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:16,770
your video seems to be
lagging behind Robert's audio.

96
00:04:16,770 --> 00:04:19,373
While he was talking about
accord, voice over off.

97
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:23,840
- [Instructor] So I'm getting
some of the chat come through,

98
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:28,840
but what I was explaining here was that

99
00:04:29,192 --> 00:04:34,192
the voiceover experience,
or screen reader experience,

100
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:38,800
I would want that to basically announce

101
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,410
that something was collapsed

102
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:43,920
and that something was
clickable to expand it.

103
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,920
And I got neither.

104
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:49,880
In fact, with the way
that this has been coded,

105
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:52,548
the downward pointing black arrow

106
00:04:52,548 --> 00:04:55,750
is now upward pointing,
but it still announces

107
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:58,840
as downward pointing black
arrow after it expands.

108
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:03,480
So while I can click on it with voiceover

109
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:05,150
because I'm reading through the content,

110
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:06,630
I just guessed at that.

111
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:08,530
And that's because I can see the screen

112
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:11,050
and I know that I can
click on it with a mouse

113
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:13,790
and do that, and kind
of expand and collapse.

114
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:16,410
So, there's a little bit of work that

115
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:17,850
they would need to do here

116
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:20,880
to make these accordions more accessible.

117
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:24,563
But they can be, and they can
look the same as they do now.

118
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:28,610
Other than maybe some color
contrast on their link text,

119
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:32,000
that looks like it's a light
green or a teal and white.

120
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,748
Which I flag that in
my mind mentally noting

121
00:05:36,748 --> 00:05:38,790
that's something for me to check

122
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:42,853
and say okay, let's do a full
check on the contrast of this.
