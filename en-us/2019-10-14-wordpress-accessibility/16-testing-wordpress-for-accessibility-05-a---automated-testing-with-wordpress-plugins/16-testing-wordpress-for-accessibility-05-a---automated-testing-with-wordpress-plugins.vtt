1
00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:01.183
<v Instructor>Now we're gonna get</v>

2
00:00:01.183 --> 00:00:03.973
into Testing WordPress for Accessibility.

3
00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:08.783
This is where you can have a lot of fun.

4
00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:12.670
There are automated tools via WordPress plugins,

5
00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:15.920
that I think we talked briefly about those.

6
00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:18.910
The Access Monitor, Siteimprove.

7
00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:20.550
There are some other ones

8
00:00:21.421 --> 00:00:23.420
that I don't have much experience with,

9
00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:25.670
but certainly, we could take a look at those.

10
00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:30.270
We can take a look at Access Monitor right away.

11
00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:33.540
We can check that out, see how that works.

12
00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.194
I have a very small Tenon subscription,

13
00:00:37.194 --> 00:00:40.500
so I can plug into that.

14
00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.420
Let's see if I can get that going with my...

15
00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:46.710
my site here.

16
00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.413
So it's just a matter of getting into the plugins,

17
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.660
and adding a new plugin.

18
00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:59.683
So when I upload it because I think I've downloaded it here.

19
00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.040
Access Monitor, this is the latest one,

20
00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:05.820
and I'm gonna install now.

21
00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.420
Let's hope everything goes well.

22
00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:10.023
Looking good so far.

23
00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:16.320
All right, and now you must enter a Tenon API key

24
00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:17.820
to use Access Monitor.

25
00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.770
Okay, so, let's go to Tenon.

26
00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:23.820
You're gonna see my API key, I'll change it later.

27
00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.640
But let's get in here, let's see,

28
00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:29.253
yup, that's what I wanna use.

29
00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:35.400
And gonna grab this API key, and plug it in here.

30
00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:40.763
Let's see.

31
00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:45.800
And see, I have Prevent inaccessible posts

32
00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:46.690
from being published.

33
00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:49.293
Oops, I didn't copy the API key.

34
00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:55.430
Copy, I'm just gonna copy it

35
00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:57.200
the old fashioned way and select it,

36
00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.683
'cause I think that maybe that was my problem.

37
00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:04.290
There we go.

38
00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.750
So I can update my settings and I have my API key

39
00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:11.253
added into there.

40
00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.390
This says Prevent inaccessible posts from being published.

41
00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:18.290
That's really kind of cool.

42
00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:23.290
So, I can update my settings and when I go to use this now,

43
00:02:30.839 --> 00:02:31.672
I can run this.

44
00:02:31.672 --> 00:02:36.390
So I don't think this will get to my installation,

45
00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:40.050
so I'm gonna look at how I can get a live link here and...

46
00:02:41.562 --> 00:02:44.930
Let's see if I can, yeah, here's a live link to my site.

47
00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:47.570
One time report, so I can create an Accessibility Report.

48
00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:49.870
I can choose some options.

49
00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:51.640
So these are the default settings,

50
00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:53.970
so I'm just gonna leave them like that.

51
00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:56.343
And I can store the test results at Tenon.io.

52
00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:59.230
So it looks like...

53
00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:04.010
Report Name, I'm gonna say WP Training

54
00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:09.203
Test Run 1.

55
00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.850
Okay, so I can create an accessibility report

56
00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:14.860
and it's gonna go and test these pages.

57
00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:16.730
I don't know how long this is gonna take,

58
00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:19.510
so I'm hoping I can

59
00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:24.910
go away from this and then run something

60
00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:29.220
on my content as I'm testing it.

61
00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:32.690
But, let's look at add a new post.

62
00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:35.000
Let's see if it's going to test out

63
00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.150
whether or not I can...

64
00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:39.240
So that, oh.

65
00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:44.240
Access Monitor isn't compatible with the block editor.

66
00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:48.170
So I need to install the Classic Editor, which I'm doing

67
00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:49.403
and I'm activating that.

68
00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:53.093
Now I can add a new post.

69
00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.913
There we go.

70
00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:58.550
So, let's see...

71
00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:02.800
My inaccessible post.

72
00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:04.943
Let's see what this catches.

73
00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:10.783
So I'm gonna do a heading level five.

74
00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:16.763
This shouldn't be here.

75
00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:24.240
And some paragraph text.

76
00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:27.103
And a Hhading level one.

77
00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:36.920
And then, let's do an image here, so...

78
00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:43.933
Oh, Add Media.

79
00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:48.320
Media Library, we're gonna add one of these

80
00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:53.100
that doesn't have alt text,

81
00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:54.350
just has a title.

82
00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:56.420
Olympus Digital Camera.

83
00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:58.120
Insert into post.

84
00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:00.580
Okay, and...

85
00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:04.257
It says, "No manual accessibility tests

86
00:05:04.257 --> 00:05:05.350
"have been run on this post,"

87
00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:07.300
Let's see what happens if I do Publish.

88
00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:10.240
Is it going to test it?

89
00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:11.863
No, it didn't, okay.

90
00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:14.763
Might not be able to do it.

91
00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:20.130
Oh, okay, I gotta...

92
00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:21.230
Now I can update that.

93
00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.083
Ah, Posts and Pages, okay.

94
00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:31.583
Update Settings and now...

95
00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:38.093
I'm gonna, let's see.

96
00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:41.330
So I'm gonna update,

97
00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:43.960
Check Accessibility, you can check it right there.

98
00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:46.470
And score is 0%.

99
00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:48.280
Post may not be published.

100
00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:50.990
Post does not meet the minimum accessibility requirements.

101
00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:52.113
Show the results.

102
00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:59.890
I've added something

103
00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:01.883
that might be a heading here.

104
00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:09.720
Of course, I added the headings,

105
00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:13.370
not in a hierarchical manner and...

106
00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:20.270
I don't have landmarks in this instance.

107
00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:23.910
I'm not exactly sure why that's coming up,

108
00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:26.690
but it's preventing me from publishing it.

109
00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:30.040
And I have an empty paragraph element, it looks like,

110
00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:32.753
because the image doesn't have an alt text on it.

111
00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:38.143
Notice that the title didn't get added.

112
00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:43.920
That was there, but it's considered empty markup.

113
00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:48.500
So if I add the alt text to this,

114
00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:53.500
which is City Intersection with Traffic

115
00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:01.850
and I update that and if I...

116
00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:04.060
Let's change these things a little bit.

117
00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:06.940
Let's make this heading two

118
00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:09.130
and this, instead of a heading one,

119
00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:11.563
I'm gonna make it a heading three.

120
00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:16.823
Now, if I update it, it's gonna run the checks again.

121
00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:19.640
And Post was Updated.

122
00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:22.667
So, it actually published it because it..

123
00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:25.840
I think it worked fine.

124
00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:27.650
Let's see, Check accessibility.

125
00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:30.260
Score is 100%, post may be published.

126
00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:31.740
So that's great.

127
00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:35.530
So this access monitor tool

128
00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:40.170
works in conjunction with Tenon, with the API

129
00:07:40.170 --> 00:07:43.220
and it will send data to Tenon,

130
00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:45.340
and then Tenon will check it.

131
00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:48.240
And I will look and see do I have anything

132
00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:50.843
where I have anything in my history yet?

133
00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:59.693
So I have some things that were Page title not found.

134
00:08:00.770 --> 00:08:03.300
Not exactly sure if these...

135
00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:05.450
Let's view the results, but...

136
00:08:05.450 --> 00:08:08.060
So it did run some results and it stored them in Tenon,

137
00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:12.330
but I also have them, I think, in these...

138
00:08:12.330 --> 00:08:16.040
So they found 364 issues for this page.

139
00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:17.190
I'm not exactly sure

140
00:08:22.380 --> 00:08:24.170
if that is right.

141
00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:25.780
But we'd have to go and look at all those,

142
00:08:25.780 --> 00:08:27.930
but it found a lot of issues,

143
00:08:27.930 --> 00:08:31.313
right with that one default page.

144
00:08:33.650 --> 00:08:36.040
Here, let's look at Access Monitor.

145
00:08:36.040 --> 00:08:37.750
We can look at accessibility reports

146
00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:40.000
and I think we have the report here

147
00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:45.840
that shows the issues.

148
00:08:46.350 --> 00:08:50.380
And you can look at what the source is for it.

149
00:08:50.380 --> 00:08:53.130
It'll tell you what that is, or what the xPath is.

150
00:08:53.130 --> 00:08:55.970
So if you're a developer and using this,

151
00:08:55.970 --> 00:08:59.013
you can go back and take a look at this and fix it.

152
00:09:03.590 --> 00:09:04.430
So I have

153
00:09:06.790 --> 00:09:08.910
a number of link issues, it looks like

154
00:09:11.322 --> 00:09:14.210
that might need to be addressed, or...

155
00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:17.473
CSS-generated content found.

156
00:09:20.810 --> 00:09:22.023
And what that is.

157
00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:26.930
You basically get a chance to see all of this information

158
00:09:26.930 --> 00:09:31.880
here in your WordPress site, using this particular tool.

159
00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:35.210
I would imagine that the Siteimprove tool

160
00:09:35.210 --> 00:09:36.570
would operate in a similar way

161
00:09:36.570 --> 00:09:41.570
because it talks to its home base

162
00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:45.510
with its testing service and scanning service

163
00:09:45.510 --> 00:09:48.823
and then probably reports back what the issues are.

164
00:09:50.092 --> 00:09:52.603
So that would be something to consider.

165
00:09:55.640 --> 00:09:58.900
So, just Coversite improved a little bit.

166
00:09:58.900 --> 00:09:59.930
I don't have that installed.

167
00:09:59.930 --> 00:10:01.710
I don't have an account with them,

168
00:10:01.710 --> 00:10:03.460
so I can't show you what that looks like,

169
00:10:03.460 --> 00:10:06.650
but well worth checking out and seeing

170
00:10:06.650 --> 00:10:08.870
if that helps your content authors,

171
00:10:08.870 --> 00:10:10.653
but also during the in-development.

172
00:10:11.730 --> 00:10:16.073
Any other plugins that you know about

173
00:10:16.073 --> 00:10:19.540
that you like or that you use to do testing

174
00:10:19.540 --> 00:10:21.603
directly within the WordPress interface?

175
00:10:24.450 --> 00:10:29.350
I think there's one called W-A-11-Y by Rachel Cherry.

176
00:10:29.350 --> 00:10:30.470
It's getting a warning

177
00:10:30.470 --> 00:10:34.020
that it hasn't been updated in a while so I don't know

178
00:10:36.780 --> 00:10:39.680
how up-to-date it is in terms of testing the content

179
00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:43.090
or fixing things, but that's another option.

180
00:10:43.090 --> 00:10:44.760
Let me see if I can

181
00:10:48.700 --> 00:10:49.543
look for that.

182
00:10:50.803 --> 00:10:53.020
So The Web Accessibility Toolbox

183
00:10:53.020 --> 00:10:56.660
is what this one is called by Rachel Cherry.

184
00:10:56.660 --> 00:10:59.370
She's a fixture in the WordPress community,

185
00:10:59.370 --> 00:11:02.313
as well as in accessibility, as well.

186
00:11:03.650 --> 00:11:08.180
Now this, because it hasn't been updated in a while,

187
00:11:08.180 --> 00:11:11.100
it may not run well with the latest versions of WordPress,

188
00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:14.840
so about two years ago, WordPress version 3

189
00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:17.330
or higher is what they were saying.

190
00:11:17.330 --> 00:11:21.360
Tested up to 4.9, so it's close.

191
00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:24.160
There are plenty of plugins that do run well,

192
00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:25.820
they just haven't been tested for 5.

193
00:11:25.820 --> 00:11:28.943
So you would just need to check it out.

194
00:11:32.370 --> 00:11:34.580
This, apparently, uses the WAVE tool

195
00:11:34.580 --> 00:11:39.070
and HTML CodeSniffer to evaluate WordPress

196
00:11:39.070 --> 00:11:43.823
from inside it, so that could be very interesting to see.
