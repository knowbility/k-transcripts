00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:01.810
<v Instructor>So let's talk about</v>

2
00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:04.003
some common WordPress accessibility issues.

3
00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:09.180
If you're not new to accessibility,

4
00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:11.490
then these are not going to be surprises.

5
00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:12.983
There are no surprises here.

6
00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:20.120
WordPress accessibility issues are very much the same issues

7
00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:24.030
that we see across all sites regardless

8
00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:25.750
of content management system.

9
00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:28.569
So we could just as easily say,

10
00:00:28.569 --> 00:00:32.970
these are common accessibility issues on sites.

11
00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:36.850
But WordPress accessibility issues that exist

12
00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:41.690
that we see common are lack of keyboard support.

13
00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:43.720
So you saw the default install, right?

14
00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:45.540
And you saw me tapping through it

15
00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:49.913
and it had good keyboard support just right there.

16
00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:56.130
We break keyboard support in WordPress,

17
00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:59.460
when we make modifications to the default.

18
00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.720
So we may install a theme from someone we don't know.

19
00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:04.173
But it looks pretty, right?

20
00:01:04.173 --> 00:01:07.880
And it may have the layout and functionality

21
00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:12.423
that we feel is right for our content and our audiences.

22
00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.530
So we do that, we put those themes or plugins

23
00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:22.860
in place in WordPress because they perform

24
00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.513
a specific function that we feel like we need.

25
00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:31.151
But then WordPress accessibility gets broken.

26
00:01:31.151 --> 00:01:33.500
And so one of those things

27
00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.700
that lack of keyboard support is very very common

28
00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.720
where we won't see visible focus outlines

29
00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:40.610
or we'll see things like

30
00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:45.610
spans or divs used in place of buttons or links,

31
00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:48.634
and I can show you sites

32
00:01:48.634 --> 00:01:53.634
and we'll pull examples from the wordpress.org showcase.

33
00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.566
So the showcase of some of the best sites on the internet

34
00:01:56.566 --> 00:02:01.070
that WordPress is proud of to promote,

35
00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:03.630
they still have some of these common accessibility issues.

36
00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.370
Some are fantastic and very accessible.

37
00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:08.024
But some are shining examples

38
00:02:08.024 --> 00:02:11.400
of how you can break accessibility

39
00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.373
by modifying the defaults.

40
00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:19.030
So lack of keyboard support, one of the big ones.

41
00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:20.870
So that includes menus.

42
00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:22.560
So when you're going through a menu right,

43
00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.524
like the main navigation menu

44
00:02:24.524 --> 00:02:28.360
and you are wanting to

45
00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:31.490
expand a sub menu,

46
00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:34.900
sometimes those are not made in a keyboard friendly way.

47
00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:36.670
The mobile menus, for instance,

48
00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:39.720
sometimes those are just clickable elements with a mouse

49
00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.300
and don't respond to a keyboard event.

50
00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:45.790
Links and buttons, I talked a little bit about those.

51
00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:47.490
But if you code those incorrectly

52
00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:49.320
and you bake those into your theme,

53
00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.850
then all of your links and buttons won't work

54
00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:53.250
for someone with a keyboard.

55
00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:58.060
Accordion controls, so those typically rely on a button

56
00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:00.661
or some other piece of code that is focusable.

57
00:03:00.661 --> 00:03:05.150
So focusable means when you tab to it

58
00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:08.620
or when you get to that element that it takes keyboard focus

59
00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:09.960
and you can do something with it.

60
00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:11.660
You can interact with that element.

61
00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:16.000
Well accordions are those expand and contract modules.

62
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.930
We see those on frequently asked questions

63
00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:20.900
a lot of the time, that they can be on any kind of

64
00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:25.440
content where you hide the content initially

65
00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:28.600
but then reveal it upon interaction, right.

66
00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:33.170
So accordions are something that we see quite often

67
00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:36.940
don't have good keyboard support and carousels.

68
00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:41.940
I have an emoji of a cat doing the famous scream pose.

69
00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:47.540
Where with cat's paws are on each side of its face.

70
00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:50.683
If you must use a carousel,

71
00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:53.820
you must think about accessibility with them

72
00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:56.450
and we see keyboard support

73
00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:00.940
lacking in carousels almost all the time.

74
00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:05.043
You can make carousels accessible for a keyboard.

75
00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:09.550
So I talked a little bit about no visible focus,

76
00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:13.530
that's something that is a designed decision that gets made.

77
00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:15.360
Sometimes people don't even realize

78
00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:17.160
they're making that design decision,

79
00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:21.920
because the theme developer made that for them.

80
00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:23.390
And they are just installing the theme.

81
00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:26.660
And they don't even realize that

82
00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:29.160
visible focus styles have been removed.

83
00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:30.370
Form label issues.

84
00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:35.060
So we see these a lot where you have a form builder

85
00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:38.720
and the form builder allows you to drag and drop

86
00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:39.640
and create a form

87
00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:44.640
and then maybe the theme

88
00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:46.890
support certain types of forms

89
00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:48.401
and they have their own styling for those

90
00:04:48.401 --> 00:04:52.100
and that styling then removes the labels somehow

91
00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:56.260
or just doesn't use labels whatsoever.

92
00:04:56.260 --> 00:05:00.773
So we see that quite a bit in WordPress sites.

93
00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:05.940
So we'll talk about how to spot those as well.

94
00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:07.630
Form validation and error handling.

95
00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:12.340
So who here has ever tried to

96
00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:15.160
fill out a form online

97
00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:17.110
and made a mistake.

98
00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:19.160
I know both my hands are up

99
00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:21.850
and they're waving frantically right now,

100
00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:23.680
because I do that all the time.

101
00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:25.960
I wish that I was perfect at filling out forms,

102
00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:28.340
but I constantly mess those up.

103
00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:31.423
And for folks with disabilities,

104
00:05:31.423 --> 00:05:33.640
form validation and error handling,

105
00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:36.493
if it's done in an inaccessible way.

106
00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:39.610
If it's presented inaccessibly,

107
00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:42.530
that can create a very confusing off-putting

108
00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:47.280
and just barrier-laden experience

109
00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:48.510
where you might just walk away

110
00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:50.610
and not complete the transaction, whatever it is.

111
00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:53.490
Filling out a contact form or making a purchase.

112
00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:58.150
So having good form validation and error handling

113
00:05:58.150 --> 00:05:59.980
and making sure that it's accessible

114
00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:04.323
is something that we see a real need for.

115
00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:10.277
Jesse asked another question,

116
00:06:10.277 --> 00:06:13.510
"Are on-hover triggers dangerous for accessibility?"

117
00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:14.840
They can be.

118
00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:19.270
So if you hover over something

119
00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:21.340
and it triggers something else to open up,

120
00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:23.831
that might be an unexpected change in context.

121
00:06:23.831 --> 00:06:28.470
But what happens if you focus on that element?

122
00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:32.690
Should it behave the exact same way as you hovering over it?

123
00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:34.240
My sense is yes.

124
00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:36.323
And what we see with those things,

125
00:06:36.323 --> 00:06:38.283
when something is revealed,

126
00:06:38.283 --> 00:06:40.890
like in a menu, if you hover over them,

127
00:06:40.890 --> 00:06:43.680
then the top level menu item,

128
00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:47.260
but it has child menu items under it, sub menu items,

129
00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:50.220
then those typically get forgotten about

130
00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:53.720
in terms of what happens with the keyboard only user

131
00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:55.790
that's not hovering over with a mouse.

132
00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:57.990
So those can be those can be

133
00:06:57.990 --> 00:06:59.950
very problematic for accessibility.

134
00:06:59.950 --> 00:07:01.738
They can be made accessible.

135
00:07:01.738 --> 00:07:04.640
And there are a number of other concerns

136
00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:06.980
around accessibility besides just keyboard support

137
00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:09.730
for on-hover interactions,

138
00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:12.200
like if somebody zoomed in,

139
00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:13.780
and if somebody zoomed in,

140
00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:16.767
are they going to miss out on what gets revealed

141
00:07:16.767 --> 00:07:18.600
if they're hovering over something,

142
00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:19.860
and then something is revealed

143
00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:21.810
in a different location on the page.

144
00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:24.083
So, that's a real issue there.

145
00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:28.370
And I see some discussion about plugins,

146
00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:32.150
to make other plugins more accessible,

147
00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:33.550
and we'll certainly talk about those

148
00:07:33.550 --> 00:07:36.799
and those are great suggestions

149
00:07:36.799 --> 00:07:41.799
from Deborah and Sumner.

150
00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:44.813
Hi, Sumner. Hi, Deborah.

151
00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:50.237
And Karen had a question as well.

152
00:07:50.237 --> 00:07:55.210
"Will using a premium form plugin like Gravity Forms,

153
00:07:55.210 --> 00:07:58.690
help to make forms more accessible than

154
00:07:58.690 --> 00:08:02.277
using a themes form stylings or another plugin?"

155
00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:05.410
So my answer to that

156
00:08:05.410 --> 00:08:10.190
and I'll have some more information on plugins in a bit.

157
00:08:10.190 --> 00:08:15.190
But my answer is some plugins that handle things,

158
00:08:16.590 --> 00:08:18.850
these commercial plugins,

159
00:08:18.850 --> 00:08:22.700
they have some good defaults but they're far from perfect

160
00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:25.550
and that is why we see the other comments

161
00:08:25.550 --> 00:08:29.020
in the chat about some of the plugins

162
00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:33.780
like contact form seven accessible defaults

163
00:08:33.780 --> 00:08:38.200
as well as the Gravity Forms

164
00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:41.600
has a wicked to form fields plugin,

165
00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:44.720
which help make things more accessible with those.

166
00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:49.720
So those are all excellent plugins to consider using

167
00:08:50.390 --> 00:08:54.230
and I wouldn't shy away from looking at plugins

168
00:08:54.230 --> 00:08:57.537
to help make your design and development

169
00:08:57.537 --> 00:09:00.520
and launch of your WordPress site

170
00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:02.110
the best it can be, right.

171
00:09:02.110 --> 00:09:06.290
But we also want to think about accessibility

172
00:09:06.290 --> 00:09:10.810
and sometimes these plugin developers

173
00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:15.590
haven't taken into consideration accessibility

174
00:09:15.590 --> 00:09:18.870
very fully or sometimes at all.

175
00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:23.870
And so to the rescue or some of these other patch plugins.
