- [Instructor] So let's talk about some common WordPress accessibility issues. If you're not new to accessibility, then these are not going to be surprises. There are no surprises here. WordPress accessibility issues are very much the same issues that we see across all sites regardless of content management system. So we could just as easily say, these are common accessibility issues on sites. But WordPress accessibility issues that exist that we see common are lack of keyboard support. So you saw the default install, right? And you saw me tapping through it and it had good keyboard support just right there. We break keyboard support in WordPress, when we make modifications to the default. So we may install a theme from someone we don't know. But it looks pretty, right? And it may have the layout and functionality that we feel is right for our content and our audiences. So we do that, we put those themes or plugins in place in WordPress because they perform a specific function that we feel like we need. But then WordPress accessibility gets broken. And so one of those things that lack of keyboard support is very very common where we won't see visible focus outlines or we'll see things like spans or divs used in place of buttons or links, and I can show you sites and we'll pull examples from the wordpress.org showcase. So the showcase of some of the best sites on the internet that WordPress is proud of to promote, they still have some of these common accessibility issues. Some are fantastic and very accessible. But some are shining examples of how you can break accessibility by modifying the defaults. So lack of keyboard support, one of the big ones. So that includes menus. So when you're going through a menu right, like the main navigation menu and you are wanting to expand a sub menu, sometimes those are not made in a keyboard friendly way. The mobile menus, for instance, sometimes those are just clickable elements with a mouse and don't respond to a keyboard event. Links and buttons, I talked a little bit about those. But if you code those incorrectly and you bake those into your theme, then all of your links and buttons won't work for someone with a keyboard. Accordion controls, so those typically rely on a button or some other piece of code that is focusable. So focusable means when you tab to it or when you get to that element that it takes keyboard focus and you can do something with it. You can interact with that element. Well accordions are those expand and contract modules. We see those on frequently asked questions a lot of the time, that they can be on any kind of content where you hide the content initially but then reveal it upon interaction, right. So accordions are something that we see quite often don't have good keyboard support and carousels. I have an emoji of a cat doing the famous scream pose. Where with cat's paws are on each side of its face. If you must use a carousel, you must think about accessibility with them and we see keyboard support lacking in carousels almost all the time. You can make carousels accessible for a keyboard. So I talked a little bit about no visible focus, that's something that is a designed decision that gets made. Sometimes people don't even realize they're making that design decision, because the theme developer made that for them. And they are just installing the theme. And they don't even realize that visible focus styles have been removed. Form label issues. So we see these a lot where you have a form builder and the form builder allows you to drag and drop and create a form and then maybe the theme support certain types of forms and they have their own styling for those and that styling then removes the labels somehow or just doesn't use labels whatsoever. So we see that quite a bit in WordPress sites. So we'll talk about how to spot those as well. Form validation and error handling. So who here has ever tried to fill out a form online and made a mistake. I know both my hands are up and they're waving frantically right now, because I do that all the time. I wish that I was perfect at filling out forms, but I constantly mess those up. And for folks with disabilities, form validation and error handling, if it's done in an inaccessible way. If it's presented inaccessibly, that can create a very confusing off-putting and just barrier-laden experience where you might just walk away and not complete the transaction, whatever it is. Filling out a contact form or making a purchase. So having good form validation and error handling and making sure that it's accessible is something that we see a real need for. Jesse asked another question, "Are on-hover triggers dangerous for accessibility?" They can be. So if you hover over something and it triggers something else to open up, that might be an unexpected change in context. But what happens if you focus on that element? Should it behave the exact same way as you hovering over it? My sense is yes. And what we see with those things, when something is revealed, like in a menu, if you hover over them, then the top level menu item, but it has child menu items under it, sub menu items, then those typically get forgotten about in terms of what happens with the keyboard only user that's not hovering over with a mouse. So those can be those can be very problematic for accessibility. They can be made accessible. And there are a number of other concerns around accessibility besides just keyboard support for on-hover interactions, like if somebody zoomed in, and if somebody zoomed in, are they going to miss out on what gets revealed if they're hovering over something, and then something is revealed in a different location on the page. So, that's a real issue there. And I see some discussion about plugins, to make other plugins more accessible, and we'll certainly talk about those and those are great suggestions from Deborah and Sumner. Hi, Sumner. Hi, Deborah. And Karen had a question as well. "Will using a premium form plugin like Gravity Forms, help to make forms more accessible than using a themes form stylings or another plugin?" So my answer to that and I'll have some more information on plugins in a bit. But my answer is some plugins that handle things, these commercial plugins, they have some good defaults but they're far from perfect and that is why we see the other comments in the chat about some of the plugins like contact form seven accessible defaults as well as the Gravity Forms has a wicked to form fields plugin, which help make things more accessible with those. So those are all excellent plugins to consider using and I wouldn't shy away from looking at plugins to help make your design and development and launch of your WordPress site the best it can be, right. But we also want to think about accessibility and sometimes these plugin developers haven't taken into consideration accessibility very fully or sometimes at all. And so to the rescue or some of these other patch plugins.
