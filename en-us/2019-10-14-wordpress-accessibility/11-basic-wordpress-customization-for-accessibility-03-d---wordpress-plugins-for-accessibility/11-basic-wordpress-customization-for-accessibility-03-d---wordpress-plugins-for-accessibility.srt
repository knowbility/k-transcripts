1
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:04,790
- There were mentions of plug-ins earlier

2
00:00:04,790 --> 00:00:08,920
and there are a number
of plug-is that provide

3
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:12,430
accessibility or that have
accessibility built in.

4
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:17,430
So I have an image here of an outlet

5
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:21,028
that basically transforms a wall outlet

6
00:00:21,028 --> 00:00:24,240
with two power outlets to one with six.

7
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,750
But then there's a seventh power plug that

8
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:27,970
someone's trying to plug in.

9
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:32,800
I often feel like WordPress and plug-ins

10
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:36,550
that's something that is of concern.

11
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:40,380
How many plug-ins can we possibly need?

12
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:43,870
There are about 900
billion WordPress plug-ins

13
00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:46,850
it seems not that many but there are

14
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:50,410
thousands upon thousands if not

15
00:00:50,410 --> 00:00:54,040
hundreds of thousands of
WordPress plug-ins and so you can

16
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,160
over do it with plug-ins.

17
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,740
So what plug-ins are out there?

18
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:05,300
We'll talk about that.

19
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:07,240
We'll talk about some really good ones

20
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:10,760
if you just need something to
start with that will give you

21
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:14,110
some accessibility support
it won't guarantee things

22
00:01:14,110 --> 00:01:15,960
then we have that.

23
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:20,840
But a lot like I don't know if
you're familiar with National

24
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:25,820
Lampoon's Christmas Vacation
but Clark Griswold is the

25
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:28,390
main character played by Chevy Chase.

26
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:31,929
One of the things that
he has is he's going for

27
00:01:31,929 --> 00:01:36,929
lights on his house and he wants to

28
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:38,455
just plug in a million lights

29
00:01:38,455 --> 00:01:43,455
on his house and he has this
one outlet where he has all

30
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:47,517
of these extension cords plugged
into it with all of these

31
00:01:47,517 --> 00:01:52,290
different splitters and it's
a mess and it's a fire hazard

32
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:55,820
and it sparks and it throws
the breaker anytime that they

33
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:57,040
all get plugged in.

34
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,980
But you have to worry about that

35
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:02,120
in the same vein with WordPress.

36
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:05,760
Just you know plug-ins can
degrade the performance .

37
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:09,610
Plug-ins can degrade the
accessibility of your site as well.

38
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:13,270
So there are you know
sometimes security concerns

39
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:14,310
with plug-ins.

40
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:16,920
So choose those wisely.

41
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:21,920
With that said I'll get
into the heart of this.

42
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:28,160
So one more note...

43
00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:36,070
I personally feel like we
should not need most of these

44
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:39,040
plug-ins that we are going to talk about.

45
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:44,713
I praise the heroes that
made these plug-ins.

46
00:02:44,713 --> 00:02:48,990
They are true accessibility champions.

47
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:52,420
They are fantastic people
for putting them out there.

48
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:57,420
But if we develop our plug-ins
and themes accessibly in

49
00:02:57,590 --> 00:03:01,320
the first place then we wouldn't
need these extra plug-ins.

50
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,683
So that's my disclaimer on that.

51
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:07,350
So this is the granddaddy of all

52
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:09,010
WordPress accessibility plug-ins.

53
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:12,910
It's called WP
accessibility by Joe Dolson.

54
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:15,760
This is something that someone
may have already linked to

55
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:22,560
but it is something that bears
kind of repeating here as

56
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:28,720
well as discussing in
detail what it does and

57
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,260
what it doesn't do.

58
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:33,930
Joe Dolson is a fixture in
the accessibility community

59
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:37,600
and in particular in the
WordPress accessibility community.

60
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:42,600
He is one of the leaders of
the team of volunteers that

61
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:47,120
work on accessibility in
WordPress I worked along side

62
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:51,600
him on the WordPress accessibility
team for about a year

63
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:54,500
and he's a great great person.

64
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:58,400
He speaks at a number of
word camps and publishes this

65
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,120
along with other plug-ins.

66
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:03,220
So it's WordPress accessibility plug-in

67
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:04,610
let's look at it.

68
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:07,383
So what does this thing do?

69
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:11,410
It adds a certain number of features.

70
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:16,260
So it will enable skip
links with WebKit support.

71
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:20,450
So it helps to move the
keyboard focus using JavaScript

72
00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:22,193
with that skip link.

73
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:25,730
It adds skip links with
user-defined targets

74
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:28,430
so you can customize the
targets and their appearance.

75
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:34,420
If your theme has removed
the language attributes and

76
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:37,670
text direction attributes it will

77
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:39,893
add them back to the HTML element.

78
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:44,900
So if you've just got a theme
that your client is in love

79
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:48,720
with or that you particularly
like but you need to add some

80
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,440
accessibility supports right
away while you're working on

81
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:55,090
the job theme this is
your plug-in to do that.

82
00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:57,360
It adds outlines to keyboard focus

83
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,680
states for focusable elements,
again this is something

84
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,653
that your theme can do or
your child theme can override.

85
00:05:04,428 --> 00:05:09,428
It can add a tool bar for
toggling between high contrast

86
00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:12,230
large print views of your theme.

87
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:16,913
I think that's something that
you should use with caution.

88
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:22,410
You can add a long description
to images and you can enforce

89
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:25,883
alt attributes on images
which is a really cool thing.

90
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:29,370
Then some of the things that it fixes.

91
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:32,040
So it doesn't just add
things it fixes some things.

92
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,860
So it removes the target
attributes from links.

93
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:38,541
So with the target equals you
know target underscore blank

94
00:05:38,541 --> 00:05:41,450
where it opens a new tab or a new window.

95
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:42,313
It removes that.

96
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:47,020
It will remove tab index from elements.

97
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:50,860
So if a developer has created a theme and

98
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:55,860
they've used tab index
values indiscriminately or in

99
00:05:56,370 --> 00:06:01,100
earnest potentially but
violating accessibility rules

100
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:02,480
it will remove that.

101
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,260
It will strip title attributes from

102
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:05,760
images inserted into content.

103
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:09,260
So this is related to that question

104
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:12,730
about you know is that an SCO concern?

105
00:06:12,730 --> 00:06:14,460
Well you know this plug-in is going

106
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:16,940
to remove it regardless of the SCO

107
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:19,290
concern but I don't feel
like that's a concern.

108
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:23,630
It removes redundant title
attributes from page lists,

109
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:25,620
category lists, and menus.

110
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:28,740
And it adds the post titles
to the standard "read more"

111
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:31,067
links so if your theme
developers has just done a

112
00:06:31,067 --> 00:06:33,070
"read more" link but hasn't added

113
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:36,770
that helper text that we saw in the

114
00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:41,040
theme review guidelines right
for having that contextual

115
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:44,650
link text then this plug-in will add it.

116
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:49,650
And it addresses some things
in the admin interface and

117
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,820
it adds labels to the standard

118
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:53,770
WordPress form fields if they are missing.

119
00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:56,870
It doesn't necessarily fix
every accessibility issue with

120
00:06:56,870 --> 00:06:59,130
forms and validation or things like

121
00:06:59,130 --> 00:07:00,920
that but it will do that.

122
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:05,338
And then it adds a couple of tools

123
00:07:05,338 --> 00:07:07,800
within your WordPress interface.

124
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:12,740
So this is probably one of the

125
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:17,740
go to plug-ins for accessibility
to patch a theme and

126
00:07:18,504 --> 00:07:23,420
some other plug-in based or
plug-in generated or powered

127
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:25,960
content on your WordPress site.

128
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:30,960
So this will do it right
away it's not a cure-all for

129
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:40,117
the problems that might be
inherent in themes that have

130
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:47,250
accessibility problems and
the goal would be to put

131
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:53,150
together changes either a
child theme or a custom theme

132
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:56,680
that gives you what you
want where you don't require

133
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:59,040
a plug-in like WP accessibility to

134
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:01,823
run and to fix your content functionality.

135
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:08,560
So any thoughts or questions on that?

136
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:12,237
I see someone said, "no plug-in can fix

137
00:08:12,237 --> 00:08:13,570
"all accessibility issues."

138
00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:15,850
That is absolutely true
and that is something that

139
00:08:15,850 --> 00:08:20,850
Joe mentions in his description
in the second sentence here.

140
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:29,600
While most accessibility issues
can't be addressed without

141
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:32,640
directly changing your theme, this plug-in

142
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,280
WP Accessibility adds a number

143
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:36,463
of helpful accessibility features.

144
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:40,993
So that's something to think about.

145
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:47,720
It can't correct every problem
by a long shot and yeah

146
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:52,400
these are things that you'll
see responsible developers

147
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:55,050
mention when they are talking
about accessibility because

148
00:08:55,050 --> 00:09:00,030
accessibility as you either
know or become more aware

149
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:05,030
of through this session
it's multifaceted and much

150
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:08,880
more complex than a binary.

151
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,313
Is it accessible or not?
