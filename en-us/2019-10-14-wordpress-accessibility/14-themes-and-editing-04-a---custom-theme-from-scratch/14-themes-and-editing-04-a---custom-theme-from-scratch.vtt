00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.830
<v Instructor>So let's talk about themes,</v>

2
00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:05.423
if you're building a custom theme,

3
00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:09.540
the editing experience with that.

4
00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.853
We'll talk about Gutenberg versus the Classic Editor.

5
00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:16.400
Many of you are aware,

6
00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:19.360
and I talked a little bit about the Gutenberg Editor

7
00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:22.010
that there are accessibility issues with that.

8
00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:26.040
You can create accessibility, accessible content

9
00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:30.100
with Gutenberg, but if you have accessibility needs,

10
00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:32.890
and you're using the editing interface,

11
00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:36.380
you might not be able to use the Gutenberg Editor fully,

12
00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:38.920
because of the barriers that were introduced

13
00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:41.410
in its design and development.

14
00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:44.980
So the Classic Editor is an option.

15
00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:46.500
And the WordPress Classic Editor,

16
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.730
when you install WordPress,

17
00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:51.400
you can go to the plugin repository.

18
00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.970
You can add a plugin for the Classic Editor.

19
00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:56.290
Sometimes WordPress will prompt you,

20
00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:58.470
whether or not you would like to install and use

21
00:00:58.470 --> 00:00:59.510
the Classic Editor,

22
00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:01.600
and you can force that on all of your users.

23
00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:02.433
You can just say,

24
00:01:02.433 --> 00:01:04.140
everyone's going to use the Classic Editor.

25
00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.390
We're not going to use Gutenberg right now.

26
00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.710
And that's perfectly valid.

27
00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:11.460
The Classic Editor has

28
00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.350
has years of development behind it

29
00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.610
which have seen

30
00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:20.880
a number of accessibility improvements in it,

31
00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.580
so you can rest assured that the majority,

32
00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:28.420
if not all of that editor experience is

33
00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:32.590
is accessible and functional for people with disabilities.

34
00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:33.423
So

35
00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.980
with either of those editors, though,

36
00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:40.593
you can create inaccessible or accessible content.

37
00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:43.190
And plugins.

38
00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:45.419
We've talked about some of the plugins

39
00:01:45.419 --> 00:01:47.989
out there to help with accessibility.

40
00:01:47.989 --> 00:01:52.460
Just know that whatever theme that you create,

41
00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:54.980
having those accessible defaults are great

42
00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:59.980
and having accessibility-ready required functionality

43
00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:05.080
and features baked into your custom theme is fantastic,

44
00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:10.080
but a plugin will destroy that in a hot second

45
00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:16.230
if it is outputting code that is not accessible.

46
00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:22.089
Your theme may be able to take and reformat

47
00:02:22.089 --> 00:02:23.750
that plugin's output, though.

48
00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:27.400
So it's something that you definitely want to

49
00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:29.780
you want to keep in mind and

50
00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:33.340
be aware of, that just because you have

51
00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:35.410
an accessibility-ready theme that you've created,

52
00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:37.790
and that's fantastic, it's passed every check,

53
00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:42.030
and your colleague, who uses a screenreader

54
00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:44.430
has verified it works great, and

55
00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.030
your other colleague who has low vision says it works fine,

56
00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:51.510
and your other friend who uses a keyboard only

57
00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:52.690
have no problems.

58
00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:56.150
If you start introducing plugins that do different things,

59
00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:58.553
that might change.
