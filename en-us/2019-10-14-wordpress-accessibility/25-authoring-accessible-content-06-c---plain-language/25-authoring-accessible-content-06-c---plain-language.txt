- [Instructor] Using plain language. So having a logical order on the page and a logical order within your your content is key to plain language, also front-loading important details. So, in a page title, instead of saying, my awesome site, colon, home, say home, colon, my awesome site, or about us, colon, my awesome company. So, you front-load those important details, that is what someone with a cognitive issues, it's going to stick with them rather than something that long winded and finally gets to the point. Using an active voice whenever possible, making sure that things aren't lost in translation of something that might be confusing, or confusingly worded, so you know, using active voice and using a tool to help you with that, so there are different services out there and different interfaces and even plugins that can help you with authoring content in active voice, and even keeping your vocabulary at a more straight-froward and simple level. Using familiar language. So if your site is geared towards children, don't use language that adults would use, and I'm not talking about foul language but just, you know, you don't have to use post-secondary, or post-graduate level content on a site that is geared for people that aren't at that vocabulary level, or industry specific jargon potentially. If you're producing a site that is geared towards kid's health, or family health topics for the average individual out there, not a trained medical professional, you wouldn't want to use all medical terminology for things, you'd want to use front teeth instead of incisor or something like that, or you might want to explain when you do use technical terms and use familiar language whenever possible, and you want to indicate language changes wherever possible as well, so that will help, and that would be if you're changing langrage from say, English to Spanish for a particular piece of content, that's WCAG requirement to indicate that programmatically, but you can also indicate that in another way as well, whether that's through a different text treatment, if you have a callout in a different language then you can treat that differently and indicate where it might be helpful for people to know.
