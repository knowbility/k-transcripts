00:00:00,830 --> 00:00:02,130
- [Instructor] Using plain language.

2
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:04,570
So having a logical order on the page

3
00:00:04,570 --> 00:00:07,680
and a logical order within your

4
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:12,360
your content is key to plain language,

5
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:14,710
also front-loading important details.

6
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:18,363
So, in a page title, instead of saying,

7
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:23,753
my awesome site, colon, home,

8
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:28,410
say home, colon, my awesome site,

9
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:33,410
or about us, colon, my awesome company.

10
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:36,200
So, you front-load
those important details,

11
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:40,490
that is what someone
with a cognitive issues,

12
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:43,480
it's going to stick with
them rather than something

13
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:46,933
that long winded and
finally gets to the point.

14
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:51,120
Using an active voice whenever possible,

15
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:55,970
making sure that things
aren't lost in translation

16
00:00:55,970 --> 00:01:00,970
of something that might be
confusing, or confusingly worded,

17
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:03,580
so you know, using active voice

18
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:06,520
and using a tool to help you with that,

19
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:11,000
so there are different services out there

20
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,500
and different interfaces and even plugins

21
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:18,870
that can help you with authoring
content in active voice,

22
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:22,978
and even keeping your vocabulary

23
00:01:22,978 --> 00:01:26,410
at a more straight-froward
and simple level.

24
00:01:26,410 --> 00:01:27,910
Using familiar language.

25
00:01:27,910 --> 00:01:32,600
So if your site is
geared towards children,

26
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:35,660
don't use language that adults would use,

27
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:39,577
and I'm not talking about foul
language but just, you know,

28
00:01:39,577 --> 00:01:43,060
you don't have to use post-secondary,

29
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:46,610
or post-graduate level content on a site

30
00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:47,870
that is geared for people

31
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:52,870
that aren't at that vocabulary level,

32
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:56,043
or industry specific jargon potentially.

33
00:01:57,212 --> 00:01:59,510
If you're producing a site

34
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:01,663
that is geared towards kid's health,

35
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,300
or family health topics

36
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:08,290
for the average individual out there,

37
00:02:08,290 --> 00:02:10,150
not a trained medical professional,

38
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:13,630
you wouldn't want to use all
medical terminology for things,

39
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:14,720
you'd want to use

40
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:19,850
front teeth instead of incisor
or something like that,

41
00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:23,250
or you might want to explain
when you do use technical terms

42
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:27,190
and use familiar language
whenever possible,

43
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:28,880
and you want to indicate language changes

44
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,743
wherever possible as well,

45
00:02:30,743 --> 00:02:35,030
so that will help, and that would be

46
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:38,960
if you're changing langrage
from say, English to Spanish

47
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:41,350
for a particular piece of content,

48
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:44,590
that's WCAG requirement to
indicate that programmatically,

49
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:47,670
but you can also indicate
that in another way as well,

50
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:51,640
whether that's through a
different text treatment,

51
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:53,630
if you have a callout
in a different language

52
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:56,210
then you can treat that differently

53
00:02:56,210 --> 00:03:00,773
and indicate where it might
be helpful for people to know.
