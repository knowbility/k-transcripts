1
00:00:02.165 --> 00:00:05.160
<v Robert Jolly>So I have a Wordpress default install</v>

2
00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.730
that I have running locally and as a developer

3
00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:11.890
it's good to be able to do this.

4
00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:15.350
We typically like to develop locally

5
00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:20.350
and use source control wherever we can,

6
00:00:20.388 --> 00:00:24.488
source-code management, something like Git

7
00:00:24.488 --> 00:00:29.468
or one of its variant flavors of source-code management.

8
00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:35.650
But basically, I just installed a Wordpress site

9
00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:39.683
and here I'm logged into the admin interface,

10
00:00:39.683 --> 00:00:44.220
but I just loaded up the page and I'm just going to hit Tab.

11
00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:47.360
So here we can see that in Wordpress,

12
00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:50.250
the defaults are already ...

13
00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.950
I can see that there are some accessibility supports.

14
00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:54.300
So I can skip to the Toolbar,

15
00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.980
I can hit Tab again and another link appears on my screen.

16
00:00:57.980 --> 00:00:59.410
Skip to the content.

17
00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:01.620
So this is called bypass blocks, right?

18
00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.341
And this is something that's just built into Wordpress.

19
00:01:05.341 --> 00:01:08.110
I believe this is running 2019,

20
00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:09.950
the theme, one of the default themes

21
00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:11.800
with the latest version of Wordpress.

22
00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:17.160
So then I can keep tabbing and I can see where I am.

23
00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.100
The focus outlines aren't great here.

24
00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:22.830
I'm using Chrome and the Edit button

25
00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.370
has a focus outline on it and if I tab down again,

26
00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:27.740
I'm in the comments section.

27
00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:31.570
If I tab again, Post Comment gets a nice color change

28
00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:34.050
plus an outline around it.

29
00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:36.310
So I can see that there are keyboard supports.

30
00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:38.270
I'm going through the links from

31
00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:42.010
the sidebar widgets here that are at the bottom of the page.

32
00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:46.060
So if I'm a sighted-keyboard-only user,

33
00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:49.590
I can get to the content on the page

34
00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.120
and all of the links and whatnot.

35
00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:53.931
So I've got a lot of links here,

36
00:01:53.931 --> 00:01:58.500
which is just a result of seeding the content

37
00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:03.500
with some random content for theme development.

38
00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.740
So you can see I'm hitting Shift Tab

39
00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:13.048
and I'm going back up all the links.

40
00:02:13.048 --> 00:02:14.870
So that's great.

41
00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:17.980
Other things that I'm looking at right now,

42
00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:21.250
just to the naked eye my text contrast

43
00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:22.600
seems very good in here.

44
00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.950
Of course, this is 2019 and it's not

45
00:02:25.952 --> 00:02:29.119
a very design-heavy theme,

46
00:02:29.119 --> 00:02:34.119
so there may not be many, if any, contrast issues.

47
00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:39.330
But I can give it a test as well,

48
00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:44.330
so I can inspect the content and I can look at the color

49
00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:48.250
here if I open up Chrome.

50
00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:51.970
And this blue against white has a contrast ratio

51
00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:56.970
of 5.2 to 1, which means it passes the double-A

52
00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:01.783
and triple-A guidelines since this is large text.

53
00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:06.620
So the Wordpress defaults here,

54
00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:08.360
really good at first glance,

55
00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:12.043
just without even doing anything fancy.

56
00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:18.440
I'm not firing up a screen reader here,

57
00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:21.490
I'm just poking around at it.

58
00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:25.220
Some other things that we can look at with accessibility

59
00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:28.340
in terms of the defaults is

60
00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:30.180
we can look at the document outline.

61
00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:34.370
And our front page here has an excellent heading structure.

62
00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:37.080
So by just looking at the document outline

63
00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:39.851
in web developer tools,

64
00:03:39.851 --> 00:03:43.140
the outline shows that my title,

65
00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:47.223
which is Front Page, is here as the heading level one.

66
00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:53.160
Then we have some other heading levels that are

67
00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:57.970
nested appropriately, and looks good.

68
00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:00.270
There are a few other things that we can do.

69
00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:03.923
We can run an automated test on this, as well.

70
00:04:05.058 --> 00:04:10.058
So if we do, say, Accessibility Insights For the Web,

71
00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:13.563
we can just run an automated scan very quickly,

72
00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:18.947
and no failures were detected on this page.

73
00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:24.080
So it passed the automated scans right away.

74
00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:26.210
That doesn't necessarily mean

75
00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:29.290
that it's 100% accessible as-is,

76
00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:33.849
but it means what could be tested in an automated fashion,

77
00:04:33.849 --> 00:04:37.693
passed and didn't highlight any issues.

78
00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:42.780
Let's see, we have someone chatting.

79
00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:45.100
Okay, yep, there's web developer tools link.

80
00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:48.190
Thank you, Christopher, for sharing that link.

81
00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:50.330
And Accessibility Insights for the Web

82
00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:52.950
is also something that you can get

83
00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:54.980
from the Chrome webstore.

84
00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:57.430
It's also a Windows application

85
00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:59.810
if you want to run it as a Windows application.

86
00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:02.240
On a Mac, you have to use it

87
00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:06.833
as a browser extension in Chrome.

88
00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:11.143
So I'll close out of that.

89
00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:17.040
Now some of the other accessibilty features in Wordpress

90
00:05:19.218 --> 00:05:22.370
that come in kind of by default

91
00:05:27.139 --> 00:05:28.640
are the media library.

92
00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:33.640
So there is a built-in way that you can add

93
00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:35.620
alternative text, any image.

94
00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:37.170
So this image doesn't have it,

95
00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:40.760
so it was pulled in, but let's give it a ...

96
00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:43.270
It's an image of a leaf

97
00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:45.580
with water droplets on it, maybe dew.

98
00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:50.367
So I will just put, "Leaf with dewdrops,"

99
00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.420
as the alternative text.

100
00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:59.420
And it says here underneath the alternative text image box

101
00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:04.880
in the media library attachment details screen,

102
00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:07.350
it says, "Describe the purpose of the image,"

103
00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:09.767
and has a link, and then it says,

104
00:06:09.767 --> 00:06:12.380
"Leave empty if the image is purely decorative."

105
00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:13.800
So that's great.

106
00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:17.070
So if you do have just a decorative image

107
00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:19.810
that is not content on the page

108
00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:23.260
or the content on the page describes the image

109
00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:26.750
and it's not needed in terms of alternative text,

110
00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:28.800
then you can leave that empty.

111
00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:33.580
You could see that the title was also pre-populated with,

112
00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:36.580
it looked like machine-generated content, maybe a file name,

113
00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:41.350
so I pulled that out, that title.

114
00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:45.900
And we can now, I think, update the image.

115
00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:46.940
Let's see.

116
00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:48.410
Yeah, it saves it automatically

117
00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:52.320
if I click into a different area.

118
00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:56.620
So that image now has an alt text on it.

119
00:06:56.620 --> 00:07:00.040
And if the theme is constructed properly

120
00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:02.560
then if you're pulling in an image,

121
00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:04.660
say a featured image or just pulling

122
00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:06.283
in an image in your theme,

123
00:07:08.082 --> 00:07:10.198
you can ensure that the alt text

124
00:07:10.198 --> 00:07:12.240
is presented if it exists.

125
00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:14.420
And if not, you can ensure that it's blank

126
00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:17.173
so that the image comes across as decorative.

127
00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:23.430
Almost all of the backend interface

128
00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:26.950
of Wordpress is accessible,

129
00:07:26.950 --> 00:07:28.750
the default install, that is.

130
00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:33.150
So other plugins may add administrative areas

131
00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:38.623
and functionality within your admin section of the site.

132
00:07:39.827 --> 00:07:43.420
So those bits may or may not be accessible,

133
00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:48.420
depending on how the plugin author or theme author

134
00:07:48.870 --> 00:07:53.570
constructed their admin interface widgets.

135
00:07:53.570 --> 00:07:56.090
But you can rest assured that,

136
00:07:56.090 --> 00:07:59.530
if you have someone with a disability on your team

137
00:07:59.530 --> 00:08:02.260
who needs to edit content,

138
00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:07.260
the Wordpress system itself is not a limiting factor

139
00:08:07.860 --> 00:08:09.690
in almost all cases.

140
00:08:09.690 --> 00:08:11.890
There may be some known issues,

141
00:08:11.890 --> 00:08:15.393
but in large part, I've heard,

142
00:08:15.393 --> 00:08:18.300
and heard from people with disabilities,

143
00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:21.840
that authoring content in Wordpress is indeed

144
00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:23.480
possible if you have a disability

145
00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:25.423
or you use assistive technology,

146
00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:29.223
and it works pretty well.

147
00:08:30.060 --> 00:08:32.710
So we've talked about some of the Wordpress defaults.

148
00:08:32.710 --> 00:08:37.630
I think we can certainly talk about more

149
00:08:37.630 --> 00:08:39.560
of the defaults, as well.

150
00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:42.587
Okay, so Karen asked,

151
00:08:42.587 --> 00:08:43.890
"Please clarify how you

152
00:08:43.890 --> 00:08:46.410
enter the test and inspection tools."

153
00:08:46.410 --> 00:08:50.759
So in almost all modern browsers,

154
00:08:50.759 --> 00:08:52.620
and I think probably every modern browser,

155
00:08:52.620 --> 00:08:56.640
there is a code inspection area.

156
00:08:56.640 --> 00:09:01.640
So what I do in Chrome, you can either ...

157
00:09:01.945 --> 00:09:03.240
On a Mac, you can control-click,

158
00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:04.850
which is basically a right click,

159
00:09:04.850 --> 00:09:07.023
and you can choose Inspect.

160
00:09:08.060 --> 00:09:12.840
On a Mac, you can also hit Option Command I,

161
00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:16.310
and that will open up the inspector.

162
00:09:16.310 --> 00:09:17.570 line:15% 
This is what's called the inspector

163
00:09:17.570 --> 00:09:19.350 line:15% 
at the bottom of my screen here.

164
00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:22.760 line:15% 
So the inspector shows the rendered

165
00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:24.040 line:15% 
document object model.

166
00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:26.580 line:15% 
So this is the rendered code that the browser

167
00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:31.203 line:15% 
is interpreting and it will basically

168
00:09:34.580 --> 00:09:37.940 line:15% 
show you, after JavaScript has added any content,

169
00:09:37.940 --> 00:09:40.730 line:15% 
if you're using something that's JavaScript powered.

170
00:09:40.730 --> 00:09:45.730 line:15% 
If any content is hidden, it will take into account that

171
00:09:50.512 --> 00:09:52.910
and that inspector works in that way.

172
00:09:52.910 --> 00:09:55.435
So like if I inspect the front page

173
00:09:55.435 --> 00:09:58.760 line:15% 
of this Wordpress test site now.

174
00:09:58.760 --> 00:10:01.810
So you can see here on my screen

175
00:10:02.910 --> 00:10:07.720
that I can look at the head of the page

176
00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:09.360
and I can look at the title.

177
00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:11.020
So it does have a title, which is good.

178
00:10:11.020 --> 00:10:13.570
That's an important accessibility check.

179
00:10:13.570 --> 00:10:15.170
It has a language declaration.

180
00:10:15.170 --> 00:10:19.070
So Wordpress will put this in by default.

181
00:10:19.070 --> 00:10:20.430
Now if your theme developer

182
00:10:20.430 --> 00:10:23.550
has made a change, that could break that.

183
00:10:23.550 --> 00:10:26.870
Wordpress defaults always provide a language

184
00:10:26.870 --> 00:10:28.650
according to the language that you set

185
00:10:28.650 --> 00:10:29.675
in your Wordpress dashboard.

186
00:10:29.675 --> 00:10:31.216
So the language of your site.

187
00:10:31.216 --> 00:10:33.690
So if you had a Spanish site,

188
00:10:33.690 --> 00:10:36.560
then it would have ES and then potentially

189
00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:37.650
a locale next to it.

190
00:10:37.650 --> 00:10:40.010
So this language attribute

191
00:10:40.010 --> 00:10:42.753
here on the HTML element says EN-US.

192
00:10:43.650 --> 00:10:45.033
That means US English.

193
00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:49.680
It could just say EN and that's totally fine as well.

194
00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:54.490
So one thing you can do as you're working in Wordpress,

195
00:10:54.490 --> 00:10:57.970
just to test things out in a non-disruptive way,

196
00:10:57.970 --> 00:11:02.530
is you can use the inspector to take a look at something

197
00:11:02.530 --> 00:11:05.220
and then over on the ...

198
00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:07.790
So if I'm highlighting this front page

199
00:11:07.790 --> 00:11:12.393
and it has a class of entry title on the heading level one.

200
00:11:13.858 --> 00:11:15.470
So it has a margin of zero on it

201
00:11:15.470 --> 00:11:20.470
and it has a few other styling declarations in CSS.

202
00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:26.220
So I can add something else to it.

203
00:11:26.220 --> 00:11:29.193
Like I can change its color to color ...

204
00:11:32.265 --> 00:11:33.370
I'll change it to ...

205
00:11:33.370 --> 00:11:35.120
Well, I can change it to any color here.

206
00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:39.460
Violet, right? So violet would change it to a violet color

207
00:11:39.460 --> 00:11:40.490
against that white background.

208
00:11:40.490 --> 00:11:43.500
And of course, if we open the color picker

209
00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:45.840
we're going to see the contrast ratio

210
00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:49.570
in the color picker does not meet the double-A

211
00:11:49.570 --> 00:11:52.520
accessibility guidelines of three to one here

212
00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:53.880
for that large text.

213
00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:58.880
So I might need to pick a different color here for that.

214
00:11:59.330 --> 00:12:02.293
So I could do an eye dropper.

215
00:12:03.560 --> 00:12:05.020
Let's see if I can do that eye dropper.

216
00:12:05.020 --> 00:12:06.700
I don't think I can.

217
00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:08.900
But I can choose a different color from here

218
00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:12.913
and it will give me contrast ratios on the fly.

219
00:12:14.990 --> 00:12:17.930
Or yeah, I can change it with this wheel.

220
00:12:17.930 --> 00:12:20.510
So you can do non-destructive changes

221
00:12:20.510 --> 00:12:23.580
in Wordpress using the inspector.

222
00:12:23.580 --> 00:12:26.260
Or any site, for that matter.

223
00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:29.010
You don't have to have even access to the source code

224
00:12:29.010 --> 00:12:32.360
to change things.

225
00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:34.220
Now, of course they don't get saved on the server,

226
00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:38.610
they don't get saved in the template files.

227
00:12:38.610 --> 00:12:42.323
So once you refresh, those changes go away.

228
00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:45.740
But it's an interesting thing to work on.

229
00:12:45.740 --> 00:12:47.070
And I hope that answered the question

230
00:12:47.070 --> 00:12:51.460
about how to enter the text and inspection tools.

231
00:12:51.460 --> 00:12:56.133
So we do have those for Firefox and

232
00:13:01.220 --> 00:13:05.880
for Safari.

233
00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:06.950
Edge has them.

234
00:13:06.950 --> 00:13:08.830
If you're on Windows,

235
00:13:08.830 --> 00:13:11.720
in Windows, it's pretty much the same thing.

236
00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:16.430
So here, we can inspect in Firefox,

237
00:13:16.430 --> 00:13:21.100
the same way that we do with Chrome.

238
00:13:21.100 --> 00:13:24.368
It has, obviously, a different look to it,

239
00:13:24.368 --> 00:13:29.368
but there are some very neat tools

240
00:13:29.700 --> 00:13:30.810
in the different browsers.

241
00:13:30.810 --> 00:13:33.100
So you can turn on accessibility features

242
00:13:33.100 --> 00:13:36.240
to check out certain things.

243
00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:38.400
So there's an accessibility inspector here.

244
00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:43.130
So in Firefox, if you click on the

245
00:13:43.130 --> 00:13:46.344
Pick an Accessible Object from this page button

246
00:13:46.344 --> 00:13:47.910
in the inspector,

247
00:13:47.910 --> 00:13:52.910
then if you get to a particular piece of content,

248
00:13:53.330 --> 00:13:55.720
it will tell you what it is.

249
00:13:55.720 --> 00:13:59.070
So these are text leaves that I am hovering over,

250
00:13:59.070 --> 00:14:01.010
or inspecting at this point.

251
00:14:01.010 --> 00:14:02.690
It says that it's a paragraph

252
00:14:03.850 --> 00:14:08.850
and it tells me what the content is,

253
00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:10.710
but also what the contrast ratio is.

254
00:14:10.710 --> 00:14:12.080
And then if I click on it,

255
00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:15.350
it just sticks with that and it gives me

256
00:14:15.350 --> 00:14:19.520
the different attributes of it.

257
00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:24.110
So it basically says what role it is and what name it has.

258
00:14:24.110 --> 00:14:28.260
So very handy when you are looking

259
00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:33.030
for the accessibility of, say, a form field, right?

260
00:14:33.030 --> 00:14:35.840
So let's look at this form field here.

261
00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:39.530
And this is a role of entry,

262
00:14:39.530 --> 00:14:42.960
and it has a label assigned to it.

263
00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:47.960
So the name of that is Name with an asterisk next to it

264
00:14:48.425 --> 00:14:51.223
to indicate that it's a required field.

265
00:14:52.509 --> 00:14:57.509
And it says that it has the required attribute on it.

266
00:14:58.100 --> 00:15:00.350 line:15% 
So if we look at just the inspector for this,

267
00:15:02.010 --> 00:15:03.630
we can look at that as well.

268
00:15:03.630 --> 00:15:05.653
So let's see.

269
00:15:06.830 --> 00:15:08.220
Inspect Element.

270
00:15:08.220 --> 00:15:11.900
So this has the required equals required attribute

271
00:15:11.900 --> 00:15:15.310
and it has the label for author

272
00:15:15.310 --> 00:15:16.780
and then it has the ID of author.

273
00:15:16.780 --> 00:15:18.697
So it says name and then it says,

274
00:15:18.697 --> 00:15:19.860
"Span class required,"

275
00:15:19.860 --> 00:15:21.280
with the asterisks on it.

276
00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:25.790
So this is what was coming out with the inspector.

277
00:15:25.790 --> 00:15:30.006
So you can take a look at what the accessibility

278
00:15:30.006 --> 00:15:35.006
aspects of any piece of content on a webpage is

279
00:15:35.310 --> 00:15:36.863
through the web inspector.

280
00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:43.600
And we'll see more of this as we go through

281
00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:45.600
how to check for accessibility, as well.
