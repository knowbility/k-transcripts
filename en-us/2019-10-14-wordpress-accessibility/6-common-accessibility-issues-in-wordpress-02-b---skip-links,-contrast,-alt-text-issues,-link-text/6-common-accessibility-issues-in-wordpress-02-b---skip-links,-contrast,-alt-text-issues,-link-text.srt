00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:02,470
- [Instructor] A common
accessibility issue is disabling

2
00:00:02,470 --> 00:00:04,260
the skip links in a theme.

3
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:08,340
So we see that quite a
bit where themes override

4
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:09,773
the skip links.

5
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:16,470
We see low contrast a lot on
both text and non-text items.

6
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:19,600
So that's always going
to be a consideration

7
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:23,473
and something that we need
to look at Alt text issues.

8
00:00:24,734 --> 00:00:26,210
This can be introduced both

9
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:28,520
from the content authoring aspect,

10
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:31,340
but also at the theme level,

11
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:33,770
or plugin level for that matter.

12
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:38,150
So Alt text issues are
widespread with WordPress sites

13
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:41,070
and link text problems.

14
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:45,350
So if you see click here
links or read more links

15
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:47,740
or continue reading links,

16
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:52,740
typically those do not get the
appropriate context on them

17
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:56,840
especially when there's
a list of posts or a grid

18
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:00,630
of posts that you have
on say an archive page.

19
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:05,630
And your theme just has a
continue reading or read more

20
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:09,080
that's repeated for each article.

21
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:13,205
Those out of context
might be very inaccessible

22
00:01:13,205 --> 00:01:16,910
and confusing for your end users

23
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:18,920
who are using assistive technology.

24
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:22,070
And you know maybe they
can't see the connection

25
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:25,330
between the headline or image of the post

26
00:01:25,330 --> 00:01:27,090
and the read more link.

27
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:31,823
So there are those link
text problems that we see.

28
00:01:33,181 --> 00:01:36,810
Theme developers often
don't understand the use

29
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:39,170
of landmarks and appropriate landmarks.

30
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:44,170
So those create accessibility
problems for folks who want

31
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:47,960
to jump to say the main area of the page

32
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:50,573
or get to the widgets or get to,

33
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:54,793
you know navigation, it's
on the page very quickly.

34
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:58,760
We also see document
heading structure problems

35
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:00,450
throughout WordPress sites.

36
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:05,450
So WordPress gives you
a very liberal interface

37
00:02:05,661 --> 00:02:09,360
for a liberal canvas
for authoring content.

38
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,430
You can create a theme that
restricts that ability, right?

39
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:17,430
And you can use specific
database fields to then control

40
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:22,560
how content get entered into WordPress

41
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,080
and then output from it.

42
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:30,080
But in general, most themes
that you find out there want

43
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:34,090
to take advantage of giving
authors the most flexibility

44
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:36,170
with the types of content the structure

45
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:40,190
of the content, the design so we end up

46
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:43,260
as a result seeing document
heading structure issues.

47
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:45,110
So that's something that we'll cover.

48
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:51,280
And in themes, if you override
the WordPress defaults,

49
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,790
you can lose out on the
language of the page

50
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:56,230
or if you have say a language switcher,

51
00:02:56,230 --> 00:02:58,740
the language of the parts of the page.

52
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:03,740
So there are ways to address that as well.

53
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:06,310
Then we have multimedia.

54
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:09,720
So multimedia accessibility
problems abound,

55
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:12,506
not only on WordPress sites,
but across the internet

56
00:03:12,506 --> 00:03:17,506
that can be a range of issues there.

57
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:22,860
So the multimedia issues
that we see the most

58
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:26,920
are inaccessible player controls,

59
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:30,330
as well as video without captions

60
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:32,560
or with auto generated captions

61
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,413
and audio without transcripts.

62
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:42,090
So Stephanie had a link in
the chat for a blog post

63
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:49,370
and I think in the link,
it says it's from 2015.

64
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:53,820
And the title looks like is why click

65
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:56,650
here is a terrible link
and want to write instead.

66
00:03:56,650 --> 00:03:59,340
And that's excellent.

67
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:01,160
I think that's a timeless post.

68
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:05,520
Sometimes I wish dates
were in those links.

69
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:10,520
No offense meant to Stephanie
and the link structure here,

70
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:18,740
but you know this could
be an article from 2006

71
00:04:19,330 --> 00:04:20,570
and it would still be relevant.

72
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:22,570
So thank you for sharing this Stephanie.
