1
00:00:01.773 --> 00:00:03.410
<v ->(Instructor) Now one thing I'd like to do</v>

2
00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:07.740
is take a look at how Screen Reader would work with

3
00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.870
sites and with WordPress sites in particular.

4
00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:15.063
We can look at some that are pretty basic,

5
00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:19.120
and some that are more advanced

6
00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:21.300
and see what we find with those,

7
00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.120
what looks good,

8
00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:25.500
what sounds good,

9
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.250
and what doesn't operate quite as what we would expect.

10
00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:32.001
So I'll fire up Safari with

11
00:00:32.001 --> 00:00:32.834
with,

12
00:00:32.834 --> 00:00:33.950
with VoiceOver now,

13
00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:38.950
and we'll go to one of the WordPress.org

14
00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:42.623
showcase sites.

15
00:00:43.787 --> 00:00:45.703
So first I have Safari open,

16
00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:51.400
and we're on WordPress.com,

17
00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:56.313
I'm gonna go to WordPress.org so let me do that.

18
00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:01.770
Because WordPress.com is a completely different thing,

19
00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.630
it does use WordPress technology,

20
00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:06.740
and it's brought to you by the makers of WordPress,

21
00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:11.740
the company automatic that it is a premium hosting service

22
00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:15.610
and theme service where you pay money for that.

23
00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:17.060
You can have a free website from there,

24
00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:19.070
but it's a different animal

25
00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:21.290
than what we're talking about today.

26
00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:23.620
So I'll go to the showcase site

27
00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:25.673
and we're gonna pull up one,

28
00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:28.363
let's see,

29
00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:32.130
these are all very good sites.

30
00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.453
So we have the Obama Foundation,

31
00:01:38.731 --> 00:01:40.850
we have Angry Birds,

32
00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:42.210
Vogue India,

33
00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.043
let's see,

34
00:01:43.043 --> 00:01:44.140
this is Finland,

35
00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:45.300
these are all in the carousel,

36
00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:46.733
Canada.com.

37
00:01:47.629 --> 00:01:49.300
I'm gonna pull up something else,

38
00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:50.150
I'm gonna pull up

39
00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:55.150
GABNOW

40
00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:57.763
This is not a social media network thankfully,

41
00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:02.940
this is a showcase site for

42
00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:05.550
bully prevention,

43
00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:07.534
standing up to bullies.

44
00:02:07.534 --> 00:02:10.570
So very important organization here,

45
00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:12.870
they've chosen WordPress as their platform

46
00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.689
and they,

47
00:02:15.689 --> 00:02:18.207
they are a featured site,

48
00:02:18.207 --> 00:02:21.000
it's a very attractive looking site,

49
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.810
from an aesthetic point of view,

50
00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:25.160
but let's just fire open

51
00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:29.010
VoiceOver now, and I should be sharing my system audio,

52
00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.683
let me know if you all can't hear it.

53
00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.610
<v VoiceOver>VoiceOver on Safari, GABNOW.org|Generations</v>

54
00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:38.196
Against Bullying, window, GABNOW.org|Generations Against

55
00:02:38.196 --> 00:02:40.509
Bullying, web content has keyboard focus.

56
00:02:40.509 --> 00:02:42.500
You are currently on web content.

57
00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:45.656
<v Instructor>So hopefully everyone heard that.</v>

58
00:02:45.656 --> 00:02:46.489
<v ->(VoiceOver) Knowbility admin to everyone.</v>

59
00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:48.572
I can hear the voiceover.

60
00:02:50.632 --> 00:02:51.776
<v ->(Instructor) Hey, all right, that's great.</v>

61
00:02:51.776 --> 00:02:52.609
Okay.

62
00:02:52.609 --> 00:02:55.650
So the chat window is also getting,

63
00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.911
getting some voiceover action,

64
00:02:57.911 --> 00:02:59.548
so I'm going to close the chat window for now

65
00:02:59.548 --> 00:03:02.075
and I'll reopen it after VoiceOver's off.

66
00:03:02.075 --> 00:03:07.075
<v ->(VoiceOver) Sofia Connell to everyone: "Voiceover works."</v>

67
00:03:07.131 --> 00:03:09.619
<v ->(Instructor) All right, so VoiceOver works now.</v>

68
00:03:09.619 --> 00:03:13.786
So I'm, I'm on the site and VoiceOver is giving me

69
00:03:14.877 --> 00:03:17.416
an instruction to enter the web area.

70
00:03:17.416 --> 00:03:20.177
I can press Control + Option + Shift + Down Arrow.

71
00:03:20.177 --> 00:03:23.547
So that's normal for loading up a website an then getting

72
00:03:23.547 --> 00:03:25.050
to the content.

73
00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:26.150
So I'm going to do that now.

74
00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:27.185
<v ->(VoiceOver) In GABNOW.ORG, vertical line,</v>

75
00:03:27.185 --> 00:03:28.760
Generations Against Bullying, web content, link,

76
00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:29.593
GAB gear shop.

77
00:03:32.041 --> 00:03:33.680
<v ->(Instructor) So that just said "link Gab gear shop."</v>

78
00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:35.350
So that's where I am.

79
00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:36.913
I'll go to the next item.

80
00:03:36.913 --> 00:03:38.060
<v ->(VoiceOver) Link, zero items.</v>

81
00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:40.070
You are currently on a link, inside of web content.

82
00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:41.990
To click this link, press Control + Option + Space.

83
00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:43.300
To exit -

84
00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:45.637
<v ->(Instructor) So that's a "Link zero items",</v>

85
00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:47.740
but it also has

86
00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:50.200
an icon with a shopping cart on there.

87
00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:51.430
And if you notice,

88
00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:52.810
VoiceOver didn't know what to do with that.

89
00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:54.900
And that was where, there,

90
00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:56.100
they don't have alternative

91
00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:57.070
texts for that icon,

92
00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:58.540
so I don't really know what that

93
00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:02.890
link zero items means if I can see that on the screen,

94
00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:06.980
because VoiceOver just said "Link zero items".

95
00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:10.360
So that is an accessibility problem, right?

96
00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:11.910
It's there for some people,

97
00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:13.520
but not for other people.

98
00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:15.043
So I'll just keep going through this.

99
00:04:15.043 --> 00:04:15.876
<v ->(VoiceOver) Search.</v>

100
00:04:15.876 --> 00:04:16.800
You are currently on a search.

101
00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:18.970
Search for:, edit text blank.

102
00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:20.560
Search, search button.

103
00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:22.594
You are currently on a button.

104
00:04:22.594 --> 00:04:23.780
<v ->(Instructor) Search button and search field,</v>

105
00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:24.890
so that's great.

106
00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:26.496
I'll just keep going through here.

107
00:04:26.496 --> 00:04:27.329
<v ->(VoiceOver) End of search.</v>

108
00:04:27.329 --> 00:04:28.210
Banner.

109
00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:29.510
You are currently on a banner inside

110
00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:31.750
Link, image, GABNOW.ORG.

111
00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:33.888
You are currently on a link.

112
00:04:33.888 --> 00:04:35.110
<v ->(Instructor) So that's, that's an image,</v>

113
00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:35.943
and that's a link

114
00:04:35.943 --> 00:04:37.950
and it says Gabnow.org.

115
00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:41.650
So that is what I assume is the Alt text is of

116
00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:43.070
that image.

117
00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:45.410
It could be maybe a little bit better.

118
00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:48.270
It could explain that it's generations against bullying

119
00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:51.834
which is what the text is in the image,

120
00:04:51.834 --> 00:04:53.093
but that would

121
00:04:53.093 --> 00:04:54.300
be maybe a little bit of nit-picking at this point,

122
00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:56.930
because we know we're on the Gabnow.org site,

123
00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:59.690
and the title was announced when I first came to the page.

124
00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:02.330
So, we'll just keep going through this nav and see

125
00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:03.440
what happens.

126
00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:04.700
<v ->(VoiceOver) Navigation</v>

127
00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:06.760
Current page, link, navigation.

128
00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:07.819
You are currently -

129
00:05:07.819 --> 00:05:09.350
<v ->(Instructor) So this is telling us that it's on</v>

130
00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:11.550
a navigation, which is fantastic,

131
00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:14.700
that's using the nav element around that

132
00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:18.203
or giving it an aria landmark of nav for this list of

133
00:05:18.203 --> 00:05:19.520
navigation items.

134
00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:21.008
So that's, that's good.

135
00:05:21.008 --> 00:05:22.840
<v ->(VoiceOver) Current page, link, home.</v>

136
00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:23.880
Link, about three.

137
00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:24.930
You are currently on a link.

138
00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:27.480
To click this link, press Control + Option + Space.

139
00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:30.840
Current page, link, link, about three.

140
00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:31.846
You are -

141
00:05:31.846 --> 00:05:32.679
<v ->(Instructor) So, so that's interesting.</v>

142
00:05:32.679 --> 00:05:34.337
It says "about three".

143
00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:36.950
I don't see a three in there anywhere,

144
00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:39.150
but that may be because of the icon?

145
00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:40.500
I'm not exactly sure.

146
00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:42.970
You notice that this is something that should expand

147
00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:43.940
or collapse,

148
00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:45.520
and I'm not sure if I click that link

149
00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:46.534
if it's going to take me to the About page,

150
00:05:46.534 --> 00:05:51.000
or if that's going to open the, the menu.

151
00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.710
Another thing that's not being announced for me

152
00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:56.170
is that this is in a closed or collapsed state,

153
00:05:56.170 --> 00:05:59.780
and when it is expanded I would expect that it would say

154
00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:01.740
that it's expanded as well,

155
00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:02.930
when it's in a screen reader.

156
00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:06.220
So just just in this very first cursory thing,

157
00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:08.880
I'm finding cursory review,

158
00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:11.730
I'm finding a few issues that I would want

159
00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:13.810
to change right away with this site.

160
00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:15.550
So I'm going to click this link and just see what happens.

161
00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:17.885
So I'm going to go Control + Option + Space.

162
00:06:17.885 --> 00:06:19.570
<v ->( VoiceOver) Press link, about three.</v>

163
00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:22.070
Current page, visited link, about three.

164
00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:23.100
You are currently on a link.

165
00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:25.716
To click this link, press Control + Option + Space.

166
00:06:25.716 --> 00:06:27.903
<v ->(Instructor) So this moved me to a new page.</v>

167
00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:32.950
But my focus stayed on the About

168
00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:36.134
link.

169
00:06:36.134 --> 00:06:38.590
<v ->(VoiceOver) Zoom.us, system dialog, mute button.</v>

170
00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:39.440
You are currently on a button.

171
00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:42.692
Safari, about, vertical line GABNOW.ORG, window about.

172
00:06:42.692 --> 00:06:45.130
(Instructor) So, so my focus stayed up here.

173
00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:50.130
So it seems like they are using some, some sort of

174
00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:53.640
java script framework to power the site.

175
00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:54.870
I haven't looked under the hood here,

176
00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:56.220
but I'm just thinking,

177
00:06:56.220 --> 00:07:00.136
this is acting like a single page application,

178
00:07:00.136 --> 00:07:00.969
<v ->(VoiceOver) https://gabnow</v>

179
00:07:00.969 --> 00:07:05.080
https://gabnow.org/about/, unselected insertion at end

180
00:07:05.953 --> 00:07:06.860
<v ->(Instructor) So it changed to About,</v>

181
00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:10.520
but it didn't really notify me that this is

182
00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:12.580
the About GABNOW page.

183
00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:14.620
It just said current link about.

184
00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:19.620
So I could get to that if I was confused by maybe finding

185
00:07:20.410 --> 00:07:23.200
out where is the header for this, right?

186
00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:25.383
So let's, let's look for that.

187
00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:27.890
<v ->(VoiceOver) Landmarks menu</v>

188
00:07:27.890 --> 00:07:28.890
No items in, Web Spots menu

189
00:07:28.890 --> 00:07:29.723
Form Controls menu

190
00:07:29.723 --> 00:07:30.556
Headings menu

191
00:07:31.879 --> 00:07:33.213
<v ->(Instructor) So there are some headings</v>

192
00:07:33.213 --> 00:07:35.430
<v ->(VoiceOver) About vertical line GABNOW.ORG, web content</v>

193
00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:37.714
You are currently, headings menu

194
00:07:37.714 --> 00:07:40.270
<v ->(Instructor) Try to pull this over to the screen.</v>

195
00:07:40.270 --> 00:07:41.710
So, here

196
00:07:42.578 --> 00:07:44.780
<v ->(VoiceOver) About vertical line GABNOW.ORG, web content</v>

197
00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:46.334
You are currently on web, headings menu

198
00:07:46.334 --> 00:07:47.167
<v ->(Instructor) There we go.</v>

199
00:07:47.167 --> 00:07:48.650
Here's our heading.

200
00:07:48.650 --> 00:07:50.297
So I can find out that there are some headings here

201
00:07:50.297 --> 00:07:51.527
<v ->(VoiceOver) Form controls menu</v>

202
00:07:51.527 --> 00:07:52.360
<v ->(Instructor) There are some form</v>

203
00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:53.840
<v ->(VoiceOver) No items in web Landmarks menu.</v>

204
00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:54.910
Search.

205
00:07:54.910 --> 00:07:55.743
Banner.

206
00:07:55.743 --> 00:07:56.576
Navigation.

207
00:07:56.576 --> 00:07:57.666
Search.

208
00:07:57.666 --> 00:07:58.800
<v ->(Instructor) So there's two searches.</v>

209
00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:01.450
I don't know if they're searching the same thing,

210
00:08:01.450 --> 00:08:02.283
or different things,

211
00:08:02.283 --> 00:08:04.180
or maybe one is in a mobile menu.

212
00:08:04.180 --> 00:08:05.293
Not exactly sure.

213
00:08:06.306 --> 00:08:08.060
<v ->(VoiceOver) No items in articles menu.</v>

214
00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:08.893
Links menu.

215
00:08:08.893 --> 00:08:09.847
Headings menu.

216
00:08:09.847 --> 00:08:10.680
Links menu.

217
00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:12.589
<v ->(Instructor) A bunch of links. And</v>

218
00:08:12.589 --> 00:08:13.422
<v ->(VoiceOver) Headings menu.</v>

219
00:08:13.422 --> 00:08:14.255
<v ->(Instructor) The headings</v>

220
00:08:14.255 --> 00:08:16.527
<v ->(VoiceOver) Headings level two two items about us.</v>

221
00:08:16.527 --> 00:08:17.860
<v ->(Instructor) And I would look for a heading level one</v>

222
00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:20.450
which doesn't exist here, but the heading level two is here

223
00:08:20.450 --> 00:08:25.450
so that's something I can maybe deduct what page I'm on.

224
00:08:27.450 --> 00:08:28.283
So that's

225
00:08:29.772 --> 00:08:31.930
<v ->(VoiceOver) Heading level two two items link, about.</v>

226
00:08:31.930 --> 00:08:33.950
You are currently on a link inside of web content.

227
00:08:33.950 --> 00:08:36.400
To click this link, press Control + Option + Space.

228
00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:38.596
To exit this web area, press Control + Option.

229
00:08:38.596 --> 00:08:40.600
<v ->(Instructor) So that's just link About.</v>

230
00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:44.410
So that is something that's going to tell me about GAB

231
00:08:44.410 --> 00:08:46.130
maybe, but I don't know that that does,

232
00:08:46.130 --> 00:08:48.943
so I will just follow that link and see what happens.

233
00:08:49.869 --> 00:08:51.510
<v ->(VoiceOver) Press link, about, heading level five</v>

234
00:08:51.510 --> 00:08:53.010
Generations Against Bullying.

235
00:08:53.010 --> 00:08:55.034
You are currently on a Generations Against Bullying

236
00:08:55.034 --> 00:08:56.900
(GAB) provides a proven, comprehensive anti-bullying

237
00:08:56.900 --> 00:08:58.554
solution for schools.

238
00:08:58.554 --> 00:08:59.387
<v ->(Instructor) So that was pretty nice.</v>

239
00:08:59.387 --> 00:09:01.310
That did scroll me down the page and it actually

240
00:09:01.310 --> 00:09:04.210
put the focus down here to Generations Against Bullying

241
00:09:04.210 --> 00:09:05.157
this -

242
00:09:05.157 --> 00:09:05.990
<v ->(VoiceOver) Heading level five</v>

243
00:09:05.990 --> 00:09:07.108
Generations Against Bullying

244
00:09:07.108 --> 00:09:08.640
<v ->(Instructor) Now the heading level seems to be all wrong.</v>

245
00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:11.300
They seem to be doing this for a visual effect,

246
00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:14.010
instead of for the document structure.

247
00:09:14.010 --> 00:09:18.600
But, but they shifted focus to this, which is good.

248
00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:22.733
So, so anyway, that's how a screen reader user would

249
00:09:22.733 --> 00:09:25.200
interact with a site like this.

250
00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:26.480
Clearly there are some problems,

251
00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:28.720
but there are some good things as well.

252
00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:30.280
I don't want to beat up on this organization

253
00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:33.730
because they are doing, I'm sure very very important

254
00:09:33.730 --> 00:09:34.563
and good work.

255
00:09:34.563 --> 00:09:36.110
And, and,

256
00:09:36.110 --> 00:09:39.270
But it just goes to show that even WordPress showcase

257
00:09:39.270 --> 00:09:43.501
sites can have accessibility issues and there's always

258
00:09:43.501 --> 00:09:45.093
room for improvement.

259
00:09:46.710 --> 00:09:48.460
One thing I want to do is also talk about

260
00:09:48.460 --> 00:09:50.372
the WordPress Speaks,

261
00:09:50.372 --> 00:09:52.913
the WordPress Speak.
