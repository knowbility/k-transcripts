1
00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:02.420
<v Instructor>So manual testing.</v>

2
00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:07.570
Something that I like to do when I first start out

3
00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:10.170
with testing WordPress sites for accessibility,

4
00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.120
is just to bust out the Tab key on my keyboard

5
00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:16.670
and start tabbing through things.

6
00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:19.800
So, can I get to everything on the page, right?

7
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.610
That was one of the things that was a manual test

8
00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:26.680
in the Fastpass's audit

9
00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:29.990
of accessibility insights, that plugin.

10
00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:33.410
So, it's super important to make sure that everything

11
00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:36.873
is accessible and actionable via a keyboard.

12
00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:40.500
The commands you wanna use for keyboard testing

13
00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.270
is just Tab to go forward in the Tab index

14
00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:46.623
in the focusable elements,

15
00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:52.490
and then Shift + Tab to go backwards.

16
00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:54.200
And then if you're on a link,

17
00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:59.050
you can hit the Enter button to activate the link

18
00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:00.290
if you're focused on a link.

19
00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:02.670
So if I'm focused on the Skip to content link

20
00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.070
and I click Enter, it jumps to the main content.

21
00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:11.070
And if I am on this wp-default, it'll just reload the page.

22
00:01:14.362 --> 00:01:18.560
So, it'd reload that page and there it is.

23
00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.263
If I get to another item, let's see.

24
00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.523
So I can get to all of these form fields.

25
00:01:28.508 --> 00:01:31.623
So, here I've got a check box, I can hit the Space bar.

26
00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:38.020
And if I hit the Space bar, it checks and unchecks that box.

27
00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:40.070
And I had an error because I didn't fill out

28
00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:42.110
the required fields because I hit Enter.

29
00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:43.810
And so the Enter will submit the form

30
00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:45.743
if you're on the check box.

31
00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:49.050
Enter will also submit the form

32
00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:52.430
if you're on that button itself or the Space bar.

33
00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:55.660
So, I can either post a comment or not there,

34
00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:58.090
but I can get to all of this with the keyboard.

35
00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:00.810
Super important to be able to do that.

36
00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.070
The other things that I look for

37
00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.250
are headings and page structure.

38
00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:05.300
We talked a bit about that.

39
00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:06.470
Headings and page structure,

40
00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:10.110
if you use this web developer tool bar,

41
00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.650
you can view the document outline and that's great.

42
00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.190
You can see the headings and this is the headings

43
00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:20.830
for my actual slideshow here.

44
00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:23.270
So the slide show is all one page.

45
00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:26.900
So we have all of the headings listed here

46
00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:28.503
and it's in a logical order,

47
00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:32.750
but we can do that on a WordPress page itself.

48
00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:34.900
So we can go to My inaccessible post,

49
00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:38.290
which is now more accessible

50
00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:41.100
according to the checks that we ran on it.

51
00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:43.530
And once this loads up,

52
00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:46.300
I should probably move back to my local environment

53
00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:49.160
so it moves faster for us, but yeah,

54
00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:53.420
here's the heading structure here, listed out.

55
00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:57.060
You can also just turn off CSS

56
00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:58.980
and you can take a look at that.

57
00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:03.080
So, let's disable all styles.

58
00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:10.280
And here we have the page linearized.

59
00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:12.460
It doesn't exactly tell you the full structure,

60
00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:17.060
like the document outline does, or like Wave did

61
00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:20.763
with its document structure but you can certainly do that.

62
00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.760
Then there are also bookmarklets that I like a lot,

63
00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:26.810
so, let's see.

64
00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:29.323
Let me re-enable styles.

65
00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:34.010
And I have bookmarklets for accessibility checking,

66
00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:36.253
where you can see all the headings.

67
00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:39.840
So this will give you the heading levels

68
00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:42.120
of anything that is a heading.

69
00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:42.953
Oh, look at that.

70
00:03:42.953 --> 00:03:45.893
There's a heading level three here that appears blank.

71
00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:49.540
That would be something for me to take a look at

72
00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:51.250
and see why is that?

73
00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:52.860
Is that really a blank heading?

74
00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:57.080
Is that there for assistive technology users

75
00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:58.180
where that's a heading

76
00:03:59.407 --> 00:04:02.253
that's screen reader-friendly?

77
00:04:03.134 --> 00:04:04.240
I don't know.

78
00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:06.100
But that would be something to take a look at

79
00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:08.193
based on just a quick check of headings.

80
00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:16.570
Contrast, checking for contrast

81
00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:18.610
is something that you'll want to do.

82
00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:19.920
You can do that in the browser,

83
00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:22.680
you can do that with tools

84
00:04:25.105 --> 00:04:28.630
like the Color Contrast Analyzer.

85
00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:29.463
Do I have that?

86
00:04:31.894 --> 00:04:33.863
I don't think I do have it here.

87
00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:37.523
So, Color Contrast Analyzer by the Paciello Group.

88
00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:41.910
They are now a part of Freedom Scientific,

89
00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:45.810
but they put out a free tool that you can use

90
00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:48.540
to check color contrast and you can use an eyedropper

91
00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:50.470
just to test all of that.

92
00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:52.170
Of course, testing in the browser,

93
00:04:53.862 --> 00:04:56.790
super easy to do now with our modern browser tools.

94
00:04:56.790 --> 00:05:00.490
So, you just find the color of the text

95
00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:01.910
for that particular item.

96
00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:04.963
So I'm gonna look for that color in the browser.

97
00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:08.220
And there it is, it's black.

98
00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:12.733
It's 17.78 to one against that light gray background.

99
00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:18.270
So it passes double A and triple A guidelines.

100
00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:19.500
So that's great.

101
00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:22.150
So we know we can do that right there in the browser.

102
00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:26.960
Let's keep moving.

103
00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:28.890
Contextual Links, we talked about the read more links.

104
00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:31.700
So looking at the links and making sure

105
00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:35.520
that you don't have a ton of the same links on the page.

106
00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:37.530
Using text resize and zooms.

107
00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:41.610
So zooming into 200%.

108
00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:45.109
On my computer it's Command +

109
00:05:45.109 --> 00:05:46.717
and you just keep repeating that.

110
00:05:46.717 --> 00:05:51.120
So I can zoom in in Chrome by just hitting Command + +

111
00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:53.530
and that's with any browser.

112
00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:58.170
I think on Windows, it'll be CTRL + +

113
00:05:58.170 --> 00:06:02.150
and you can just zoom in and make sure

114
00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:06.723
that nothing overlaps or causes horizontal scrolling

115
00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:13.195
when you get to a certain size, like 200%.

116
00:06:13.195 --> 00:06:15.734
You can go to extremes like 400% or more

117
00:06:15.734 --> 00:06:19.140
and that's certainly a valid way to test,

118
00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:20.853
super quick to test that way, too.

119
00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:25.140
Testing the resizing of text only,

120
00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:28.333
you can do that with Firefox quite easily.

121
00:06:29.715 --> 00:06:32.453
That's also recommended to do that.

122
00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:35.190
So parsing and validation.

123
00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:37.030
A lot of the automated tools with this for you,

124
00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:39.560
but you can also run any of your pages

125
00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:44.427
through the tool provided by the W3C.

126
00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:50.720
It's the validator, it's the new validator so W3C validator.

127
00:06:57.590 --> 00:07:01.380
You can run something through there and basically

128
00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:06.100
knowing if a page validates or not

129
00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:08.080
can give you hints that whether or not

130
00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:09.933
there are accessibility issues.

131
00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:15.010
And then, of course, you have screen reader testing, so.
