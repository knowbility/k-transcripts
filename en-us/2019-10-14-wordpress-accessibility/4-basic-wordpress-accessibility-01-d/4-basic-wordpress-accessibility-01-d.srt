We had a question about the WordPress

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:03,750
can be used on Safari on Mac

3
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:06,010
and just wanted, I guess we just should

4
00:00:06,010 --> 00:00:08,420
phrase that that as Wordpress is a CMS

5
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:13,300
that's hosted on a server,
and the site can be

6
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:15,260
viewed on any browser.

7
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:17,223
- [Robert Jolly, Instructor]
Absolutely, yep, yep.

8
00:00:17,223 --> 00:00:18,800
That's a good question.

9
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:23,490
So, and good answer, so any modern browser

10
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:26,300
or operating system, mobile or not,

11
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:28,710
should be able to view
content that you author

12
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:29,765
in Wordpress.

13
00:00:29,765 --> 00:00:34,530
Wordpress will run on a
variety of server technologies,

14
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:40,600
but it does require PHP and a database,

15
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:44,677
usually MySQL or some
MySQL-compatible variant.

16
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:51,570
Something like MariaDB or even Postgre.

17
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:55,030
There are ports of Wordpress over to run

18
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:57,540
on Windows servers, but typically it runs

19
00:00:57,540 --> 00:01:02,540
on a LAMP Stack, which is
Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP.

20
00:01:04,570 --> 00:01:09,570
And absolutely, Safari can render content

21
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:15,200
on Wordpress sites, and I'll
bring that up in Safari now.

22
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:20,030
And you can author content,
log into the Admin interface,

23
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:21,990
all of that good stuff in Safari.

24
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:26,990
So here I have Safari, and
it renders very similarly

25
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:32,330
to how things rendered
on the other browsers.

26
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:47,610
And if I go to the Admin page,
I can log in with Safari.

27
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:00,663
Sure, I'll save password.

28
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:06,540
And I can get in there and
go to town with doing work.

29
00:02:08,510 --> 00:02:12,950
So I can add a new post
here and add the title.

30
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:22,560
So yep, absolutely, Safari's
A-OK to author content.

31
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:34,350
And then I can hit Publish,
and I can go and view

32
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:37,930
the post, and there it
is, my test post is here.

33
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:42,250
And it has just an image as the content

34
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:45,470
because that's what I did as
I was authoring the content.

35
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:50,470
So I can, I believe I can
inspect as well with Safari?

36
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:58,150
Maybe I do not have, I may
not have the Safari inspector

37
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:05,190
active on this yet, but you
can do very similar stuff

38
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:10,073
with all the browsers that
I was just demonstrating.

39
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:17,930
And one thing I will do
is we'll test, we'll show

40
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:21,403
how a screen reader on
the Mac, Voice Over,

41
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:25,100
works with Safari because
that is the best combination

42
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:28,540
to test with when you're
testing with a screen reader

43
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:31,833
on a Mac is to use Safari and Voice Over.

44
00:03:39,553 --> 00:03:44,553
So Jessie asked, "Did
Knowbility choose to focus

45
00:03:44,757 --> 00:03:48,127
"a classroom on Wordpress because we found

46
00:03:48,127 --> 00:03:52,427
"that Wordpress' tools are
more robust for testing

47
00:03:52,427 --> 00:03:55,507
"and checking accessibility
or is it more about

48
00:03:55,507 --> 00:03:57,707
"marketshare going for
potentially the most

49
00:03:57,707 --> 00:04:00,777
"prevalent platform to cover
as many people as possible?"

50
00:04:02,526 --> 00:04:06,163
I think Wordpress is
one of the most popular

51
00:04:11,171 --> 00:04:15,360
and most widely-used CMSs,
content management systems,

52
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:19,520
and publishing platforms in
use on the Internet today.

53
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:24,390
The Wordpress community claims
somewhere around 30 percent

54
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:28,750
or more of the top sites on the Internet

55
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:33,750
and top millions of sites are
using Wordpress to power it.

56
00:04:36,170 --> 00:04:40,760
So it remains an extremely
popular publishing platform.

57
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:43,250
It's free and open
source, that is something

58
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:48,070
that has contributed
to it, but its relative

59
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:53,070
ease of use for folks
who are non-technical

60
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:57,100
as well as technically-minded people,

61
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:03,540
developers and designers,
have fueled its popularity.

62
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:06,770
So it reaches a vast number of people.

63
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:10,220
So that we do feel like
is very important for us

64
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:12,910
to cover a course on Wordpress,

65
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:16,160
and Wordpress itself has
done a good job overall

66
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,802
in the community of
supporting accessibility

67
00:05:18,802 --> 00:05:21,130
within its platform.

68
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:22,990
It doesn't mean that things are perfect,

69
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:26,300
and we'll go over common
problems in just a moment

70
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:31,300
with Wordpress installs, but
authoring Wordpress sites

71
00:05:33,435 --> 00:05:36,340
does not automatically
mean you're going to author

72
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:37,760
something that's inaccessible.

73
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:40,040
It doesn't automatically mean
that it will be accessible,

74
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,240
but it can be, and that's
what we want to focus

75
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:46,293
on here today is how do
we make the availability

76
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:53,990
of accessibility in
Wordpress more widely known.

77
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:54,823
What can you do?

78
00:05:54,823 --> 00:05:56,140
What's out there right now?

79
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:59,230
What are the best practices?

80
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:03,690
So certainly the popularity
of Wordpress contributed

81
00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:08,690
to our decision to put
on this course, no doubt.

82
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:13,840
And most of you in this
session have probably

83
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:17,540
some familiarity with
Wordpress, might even run

84
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:19,250
several Wordpress sites.

85
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:23,720
So that's certainly our target audience,

86
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,580
but if you're new to Wordpress,

87
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:27,430
this is a good intro I think, as well,

88
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:31,430
in terms of what do I
need to be concerned with

89
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:33,163
for accessibility in Wordpress.
