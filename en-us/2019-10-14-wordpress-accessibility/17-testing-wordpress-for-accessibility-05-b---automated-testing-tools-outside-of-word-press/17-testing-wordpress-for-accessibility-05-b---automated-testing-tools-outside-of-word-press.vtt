00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.210
<v Instructor>Other things we can do for testing.</v>

2
00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:06.380
So automated tools exist outside of WordPress,

3
00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:10.870
and that is what I like to do first

4
00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:12.910
when I use an automated tool, is to use

5
00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:14.670
something that's outside of WordPress.

6
00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.480
So Accessibility Insights for the Web

7
00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.090
was provided recently, earlier this year

8
00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:24.990
in March, they announced the launch of it,

9
00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.990
Deque Labs and Microsoft, or Deque Systems produced it.

10
00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:35.830
So Microsoft underwrote a lot of the development efforts

11
00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:39.490
to create browser plugins, but also a Windows application.

12
00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:42.010
So I'll make sure I update this deck

13
00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:45.194
to have the link to it, but it is

14
00:00:45.194 --> 00:00:49.500
accessibilityinsights.io, is the link.

15
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.460
And you can add it to chrome as a plugin,

16
00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.460
you can add it to Microsoft Edge Insider

17
00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:57.790
if you're on Windows and running Edge,

18
00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:59.740
and the Insider version of it,

19
00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:02.150
or you can download the application for Windows.

20
00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:04.670
So you can check Windows applications

21
00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:07.990
as well as, I think, web applications.

22
00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:10.343
So with that particular one.

23
00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:14.700
But I have it installed in Chrome,

24
00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.270
because it's pretty awesome, and one of the things

25
00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.280
that we can do, is we can take a look at...

26
00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.080
where's my site, so here we go.

27
00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:30.340
So we can take a look at this site

28
00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:32.120
with Accessibility Insights for the Web,

29
00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:34.600
so here's the front page, and it will run

30
00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.140
the checks that it knows about to do.

31
00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.290
So there are a few different things that you can do.

32
00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:43.980
So you can run this FastPass, which is,

33
00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:46.090
it runs two tests to find the most common

34
00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:48.320
accessibility issues in less than five minutes,

35
00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:51.810
you can do assessment, which is a guided walkthrough

36
00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.770
of both automated and manual testing.

37
00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:56.920
This is an excellent tool for that,

38
00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.750
and then you can do ad hoc tools,

39
00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:03.860
which you can run just one by one.

40
00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:05.450
So, first thing I'll do is I'll just

41
00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:07.310
open up a FastPass check.

42
00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:12.310
So I'm going to change this window a little bit.

43
00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:15.280
So no failures were detected on this,

44
00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.173
lemme change this window too, this runs side by side.

45
00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:24.830
So no failures were found with

46
00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:27.940
the automated checks using this.

47
00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:29.710
Much different than what Tenon did

48
00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:33.300
with it's automated checks, as you are aware now.

49
00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:35.730
But then you can also run tab stop checking,

50
00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.780
so you can check for your tab stops.

51
00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:41.040
So I just turned it on, I toggled it on over here

52
00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.630
in this other window for accessibility insights,

53
00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:47.610
and then over on the other window once I hit tab,

54
00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:51.080
that skip to content came up with a red circle on it,

55
00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:54.070
and it's gonna show the tab stops.

56
00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:58.190
So then it says wp-default, which is that home link,

57
00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:01.330
and then it skips down to the next focusable element,

58
00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:05.070
which is the comment box, and then the name, email,

59
00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:06.920
but it shows a pathway, and it shows

60
00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:08.790
the number for each of these.

61
00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:12.443
So basically if this looks like it's out of place,

62
00:03:14.586 --> 00:03:16.510
or out of order, if the tab order

63
00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:20.460
visibly jumps around on the page when you're doing this,

64
00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:23.270
then you probably have a problem

65
00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:28.270
with the page structure, or hierarchy on your page.

66
00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:33.340
So this is one of the tools that you can run

67
00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:38.100
straight out of the box with WordPress.

68
00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:43.100
So yes, we'll be sharing all of this after

69
00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:48.320
we have a chance to get everything captioned for this.

70
00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:50.330
So we'll be not only sharing the deck,

71
00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:53.970
the slide deck, but also you'll have

72
00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:55.453
full access to the recording.

73
00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:01.730
Now, that's just the FastPass testing of this page.

74
00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:04.030
So what if we wanna do a full assessment?

75
00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:06.670
So of course we have the automated checks,

76
00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:09.520
and it's scanning, and if it's the same

77
00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:11.060
automated checks, it should come back

78
00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:13.160
with the same results, so it did.

79
00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:17.850
It passed all of these different things on this homepage.

80
00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:21.853
So, if it didn't, then it would flag those items.

81
00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:26.110
Keyboard navigation, so this is where

82
00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:30.497
we would have, you know, the visible focus

83
00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:34.570
and all of that, of all of the focus paths.

84
00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:37.980
So we can do visual helper, and users

85
00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:40.570
must be able to navigate to all interactive components,

86
00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:44.790
so this is that keyboard focusing that we did before.

87
00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:46.870
But this will walk you through all

88
00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:48.120
of the different types of tests

89
00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:51.550
that you need to do, tells you how to test them,

90
00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:56.550
as well as a way to flag them as a potential pass or fail.

91
00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:00.670
You can also export the results to Github,

92
00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:03.180
or I believe to other formats as well,

93
00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:05.440
but there are some things you can do in settings.

94
00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:09.060
So you can use Azure Boards, you can

95
00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:14.800
file issues in Github, or you can also change

96
00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:18.480
other settings like the contrast of this tool.

97
00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:22.680
But it's fantastic, and it will run a number

98
00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:25.540
of different, help you run a number of different tests.

99
00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:29.920
Can't recommend it highly enough, it's just that good.

100
00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:31.500
So I'll close out of that window,

101
00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:33.510
and we'll talk about some other tools,

102
00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:35.870
'cause that's not the only game in town

103
00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:37.293
with accessibility testing.

104
00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:42.000
Inside Chrome you can run an audit using Lighthouse

105
00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:47.000
and using the accessibility testing tools there.

106
00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:48.910
You can also run it against performance

107
00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:51.670
and things like that, so I'm going to do

108
00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:55.530
just that right now, so I'm gonna open up inspector,

109
00:05:55.530 --> 00:06:00.530
and in here, we have an audits panel.

110
00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:06.870
And you can run audits choosing which device type,

111
00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:11.180
mobile or desktop, which audits you wanna run,

112
00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:14.450
performance, progressive web app, best practices,

113
00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:17.080
accessibility, SEO, so you can run all of those

114
00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:19.703
or just one of them, doesn't matter.

115
00:06:20.894 --> 00:06:23.850
You can simulate a slow connection if you want,

116
00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:26.660
for performance, I'm just gonna say no throttling,

117
00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:28.120
and I'm just gonna click on run audit.

118
00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:31.380
So I'm running the accessibility audit using Lighthouse.

119
00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:35.230
Lighthouse uses the aXe testing engine,

120
00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:38.020
just like the Accessibility Insights for the Web does,

121
00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:40.520
so it should get about the same results.

122
00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:46.480
So it's auditing this right now, and it's generating

123
00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:49.020
a report, and lo and behold, because it's running

124
00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:51.490
the same engine that Accessibility Insights was,

125
00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:54.070
and it didn't find any automated issues,

126
00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:56.530
it gives me 100 for accessibility.

127
00:06:56.530 --> 00:07:01.333
100% score, so I'm getting a good grade right now, for that.

128
00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:05.570
The thing to keep in mind though

129
00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:10.570
with any automated testing, is what I have repeated

130
00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:13.920
a few times, and what I saw Sumner and others

131
00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:16.940
post in the chat when I looked over, is that

132
00:07:21.190 --> 00:07:23.140
this is not a magical endorsement

133
00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:26.500
that your site is fully accessible.

134
00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:29.133
If you get 100 on the accessibility audit,

135
00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:33.250
you know, celebrations are probably not in order,

136
00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:35.520
because only a subset of issues

137
00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:39.430
can be automatically detected, and they say that here.

138
00:07:39.430 --> 00:07:43.500
And so they say, "manual testing is also encouraged."

139
00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:48.020
So it tells you what passed in here,

140
00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:52.170
which is really cool, so it tells you what it checks for,

141
00:07:52.170 --> 00:07:53.660
and you can expand these items

142
00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:56.180
and learn more about them, learn more

143
00:07:56.180 --> 00:07:58.850
about these checks, which is great.

144
00:07:58.850 --> 00:08:03.850
And you can see what was not applicable,

145
00:08:04.980 --> 00:08:06.840
so I didn't have any access keys,

146
00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:08.750
so it didn't check it, I didn't have audio,

147
00:08:10.117 --> 00:08:12.217
I didn't have an iframe or frame elements,

148
00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:15.310
things like that, video elements, I don't have them

149
00:08:15.310 --> 00:08:17.780
on this particular page, so it didn't check them.

150
00:08:17.780 --> 00:08:20.223
And then, things to automatically check.

151
00:08:21.620 --> 00:08:26.620
This all is very helpful to review as well,

152
00:08:27.670 --> 00:08:31.360
so this could be your guide for manual review as well.

153
00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:33.180
You can run the automated checks,

154
00:08:33.180 --> 00:08:35.220
have your developers run it if you're not a developer,

155
00:08:35.220 --> 00:08:38.080
but then have them go through and do

156
00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:40.143
the manual review steps as well.

157
00:08:41.060 --> 00:08:42.630
And that would be for each page,

158
00:08:42.630 --> 00:08:45.930
or each page type, each template on the site

159
00:08:45.930 --> 00:08:47.680
is what I would recommend for that.

160
00:08:49.340 --> 00:08:54.340
So, that is the Chrome audit via Lighthouse,

161
00:08:55.940 --> 00:08:59.740
which is great, there's the WAVE tool

162
00:08:59.740 --> 00:09:02.340
that is available as a browser plugin.

163
00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:05.770
You can also just point sites at,

164
00:09:05.770 --> 00:09:08.060
or point WAVE at sites, and it will crawl them,

165
00:09:08.060 --> 00:09:12.010
or it will run a scan on a particular single page.

166
00:09:12.010 --> 00:09:15.960
So let's look at this with WAVE.

167
00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:20.960
So, with WAVE I have a tool here,

168
00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:23.870
the WAVE extension, and it says WAVE this page.

169
00:09:23.870 --> 00:09:27.630
So it just waved the page, and then it's saying,

170
00:09:27.630 --> 00:09:32.430
okay, I've got zero errors here, which is great,

171
00:09:32.430 --> 00:09:36.090
I have seven alerts, wonder what those are.

172
00:09:36.090 --> 00:09:39.010
I have eight features, 13 structural elements,

173
00:09:39.010 --> 00:09:42.690
and you can see it with styles, without styles,

174
00:09:42.690 --> 00:09:46.260
which is a good way to check if the page makes sense

175
00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:51.130
without your markup in terms of visual language,

176
00:09:51.130 --> 00:09:56.130
and then contrast, are there contrast problems.

177
00:09:56.510 --> 00:09:59.090
You know, here are contrast tools,

178
00:09:59.090 --> 00:10:02.750
so you can basically check the contrast

179
00:10:02.750 --> 00:10:07.237
of something and see if it meets the needs.

180
00:10:09.250 --> 00:10:12.070
So these alerts, there are seven

181
00:10:12.070 --> 00:10:14.270
possible headings on this page they're saying.

182
00:10:14.270 --> 00:10:16.200
Hmm, is this a heading?

183
00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:19.570
Yeah, I don't know, you know, is it, should it be?

184
00:10:19.570 --> 00:10:21.980
If it is, then maybe that's a problem.

185
00:10:21.980 --> 00:10:23.490
But they don't know, so they're just

186
00:10:23.490 --> 00:10:25.520
flagging it as a possible issue.

187
00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:27.650
There are six things that have form labels,

188
00:10:27.650 --> 00:10:31.570
and they're all listed with green icons on them,

189
00:10:31.570 --> 00:10:34.800
with a little tag, so that means these are good.

190
00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:36.290
These are good form labels.

191
00:10:36.290 --> 00:10:37.860
If these were not labeled correctly,

192
00:10:37.860 --> 00:10:42.860
WAVE would have those under errors, and would tell you

193
00:10:43.710 --> 00:10:46.957
how many form labels with a different icon,

194
00:10:46.957 --> 00:10:49.170
with red on it in a different section

195
00:10:50.230 --> 00:10:55.210
to alert you to an error.

196
00:10:55.210 --> 00:10:57.810
So it tells you about the heading levels,

197
00:10:57.810 --> 00:11:00.810
and things like that, and basically gives you

198
00:11:00.810 --> 00:11:03.670
all of the page information.

199
00:11:03.670 --> 00:11:06.400
You can see that you can get an outline with WAVE as well.

200
00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:10.100
So you can do basic accessibility testing with WAVE

201
00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:12.743
on any page very very easily.
