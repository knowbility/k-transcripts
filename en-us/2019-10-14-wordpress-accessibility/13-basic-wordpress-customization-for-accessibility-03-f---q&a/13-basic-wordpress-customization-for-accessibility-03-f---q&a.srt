1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:01,930
- Any other items

2
00:00:03,458 --> 00:00:04,710
that you all know about,

3
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:06,193
that you wanna discuss.

4
00:00:08,561 --> 00:00:12,640
You can look up the term
accessibility in the plugins

5
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:14,350
directory on WordPress and get

6
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:20,173
hundreds of plugins, some of
them are really, really good.

7
00:00:23,572 --> 00:00:26,070
Some of them not so much but,

8
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:27,800
what plugins do you use

9
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:30,953
for accessible content?

10
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:36,310
So, there was Deborah, in the chat

11
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,230
posted a link

12
00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:40,110
it's

13
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:42,020
five awesome

14
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:44,390
accessibility testing tools

15
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:46,163
from Claire at A Bright Clear Web.

16
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,193
So

17
00:00:52,401 --> 00:00:54,750
they're talking about
using a screen reader,

18
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:56,090
using a color contrast analyser,

19
00:00:56,090 --> 00:00:58,540
I'm looking to see if
there are any plugins here.

20
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,040
Looks like there are browser plugins

21
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,783
but I'm not seeing a WordPress plugin yet.

22
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:17,600
All right.

23
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,237
Karen asks, "Does anyone know of a good

24
00:01:20,237 --> 00:01:23,200
"accessible plugin for charts and graphs?"

25
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,610
That's a great question.

26
00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:26,610
I don't know

27
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:28,430
of any for WordPress

28
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:32,280
that do that accessibly.

29
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:33,917
With Joe Dolsons

30
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:37,430
WP accessibility

31
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:38,600
plugin

32
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:41,510
you can add long descriptions to images.

33
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:43,780
So, for complex

34
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:44,613
images

35
00:01:44,613 --> 00:01:45,790
that look like charts

36
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:47,410
that might be a way to do that.

37
00:01:47,410 --> 00:01:49,580
But if you have

38
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:51,900
an interactive chart,

39
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:56,610
something that, you know,
maybe it's drawn via data,

40
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:58,370
right, coming out of WordPress

41
00:01:58,370 --> 00:02:02,180
and then it needs to be accessible.

42
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:03,850
That would be something

43
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,570
that I'd need to look at,

44
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:09,240
to see if there's anything
that's accessible out there.

45
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:11,630
I don't know of a plugin that will do

46
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:13,820
accessible charts and graphs just

47
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:16,373
dedicated to that for WordPress.

48
00:02:18,168 --> 00:02:19,790
SiteImprove, yeah.

49
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:21,567
So Karen--

50
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:25,190
Different Karen, Karen with a K,

51
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:28,500
had asked, are there any
thoughts on site improve?

52
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:29,870
So,

53
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:30,703
SiteImprove

54
00:02:31,997 --> 00:02:33,563
is a service,

55
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,920
a software is a service

56
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:40,170
almost like a third party hosted

57
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:41,710
place to

58
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:42,810
run

59
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:43,643
checks

60
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:47,190
of your content

61
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:48,870
both for

62
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:51,560
SEO content quality,

63
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:56,560
link validation, things like
that, as well as accessibility.

64
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:57,503
So,

65
00:02:58,691 --> 00:03:00,410
SiteImprove

66
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:01,320
is very active

67
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,910
in the accessibility community

68
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:04,960
and they have a plugin

69
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:07,690
and we'll talk about that one,

70
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:10,490
for plugins for actually validating

71
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:12,530
or checking for accessibility.

72
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:16,690
It works with their subscription service.

73
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:17,523
So

74
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:20,600
I think that could be a valid way

75
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:23,290
to do checks for accessibility,

76
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:26,513
it isn't the only thing you should do but,

77
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:30,660
but definitely there's a plugin for that.

78
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:32,140
And we'll look at that,

79
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:34,173
well we'll go ahead and
look at it right now.

80
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:36,630
While I get a drink of water.

81
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:49,210
So this plugin, which I haven't used,

82
00:03:49,210 --> 00:03:51,430
I am familiar with folks at SiteImprove

83
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:53,503
and like them very much, good folks,

84
00:03:55,259 --> 00:03:57,123
but I can't comment on the

85
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,250
the plugin itself,
other than what they say

86
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:05,360
but it basically allows you to

87
00:04:08,210 --> 00:04:11,340
check your content while
your creating and editing it

88
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:17,810
and then possibly get
reports in side WordPress

89
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:21,460
of any scans that SiteImprove does of your

90
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:22,913
content on your site.

91
00:04:25,969 --> 00:04:29,000
So that's, I wanna see, I
don't think they have any,

92
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,720
they don't have any screen shots there but

93
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:36,210
basically you have to have
an account with SiteImprove,

94
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:38,480
it does like they have a free trial so,

95
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:40,170
it'd be worth checking that out

96
00:04:41,317 --> 00:04:42,917
and seeing what that looks like.

97
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,380
There's another plugin as well

98
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:52,665
that

99
00:04:52,665 --> 00:04:54,210
we can talk about,

100
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:56,700
it's called Access Monitor.

101
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:58,550
So Access Monitor

102
00:05:04,846 --> 00:05:05,929
for WordPress

103
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,480
is built by Joe Dolson

104
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:12,810
and it hooks into a third party

105
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:16,300
service called Tenon, T-E-N-O-N

106
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:17,730
so let

107
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:18,700
me go to that

108
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:21,170
and we'll talk about that

109
00:05:21,170 --> 00:05:24,120
because that's another one
where you can check your content

110
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,513
right in WordPress,

111
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,713
for accessibility.

112
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,610
So this one,

113
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:44,570
it requires an API key

114
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:46,030
and

115
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:47,970
it runs

116
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:49,780
basically this automated scan

117
00:05:52,597 --> 00:05:53,670
and it can

118
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:56,310
have you

119
00:05:57,290 --> 00:05:58,810
basically check your content

120
00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:00,360
before you're allowed to publish it,

121
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,700
you can have a setting inside of it so,

122
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:04,610
we can take a look at that when we

123
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:08,693
get into the testing portion
and we'll test drive that.

124
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:13,630
So we've talked about child themes

125
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:19,670
and we've talked about them in relation to

126
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:23,180
taking an accessibility ready
theme or a commercial theme

127
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:25,010
and developing

128
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:26,400
those out

129
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,193
even further and customizing them.

130
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:31,720
But what about custom parent themes?

131
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,230
Lets talk about those

132
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:38,010
so what if you wanna build
your theme from scratch?

133
00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:38,883
Lets see.

134
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,813
Lets see if I can find.

135
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:45,080
So the theme handbook

136
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:47,350
basically lays out everything

137
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:51,030
that you can do with a theme

138
00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:53,570
and what are the
building.blocks of a theme.

139
00:06:53,570 --> 00:06:57,110
So I won't get into that in detail but

140
00:07:03,283 --> 00:07:05,310
the process of building a theme can be

141
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:07,440
from scratch, can be

142
00:07:09,155 --> 00:07:09,988
pretty complex

143
00:07:09,988 --> 00:07:14,270
but this is the part of our
day where we do get into

144
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:15,973
the complexities of it so,

145
00:07:17,130 --> 00:07:19,840
we have a certain number of required files

146
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,790
that you need to have, you have to have

147
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:25,660
the index page as well as the

148
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:27,293
style.CSS.

149
00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:30,040
Then

150
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:33,600
you have these optional template files,

151
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:36,430
localisation files and, of course,

152
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:38,640
with good theme building practices,

153
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:40,990
you would be separating out your graphics,

154
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:44,590
JavaScripts, other text files from there.

155
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:45,423
But

156
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,230
with themes

157
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:51,390
you have a number of options, right?

158
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:55,140
You can basically build
your site from scratch

159
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:55,973
with a theme.

160
00:07:55,973 --> 00:07:57,600
You can make it look any way that you want

161
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,440
and all of those themes

162
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,343
out in the theme repository,

163
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,210
people started from scratch

164
00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:06,390
or from some sort of starter framework

165
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:08,950
that allowed them to build their own

166
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:11,593
very own custom theme
to share with others.

167
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:15,823
So there are,

168
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:17,910
there are a number of things

169
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:20,800
that are available to you if you're doing

170
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,500
these custom parent themes.

171
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:25,730
So, that accessibility ready theme review

172
00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:28,263
that we looked at before.

173
00:08:28,263 --> 00:08:32,150
So these required items
in the theme review

174
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:34,240
are something that, if
you're developing your

175
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,510
own theme from scratch, even if you're not

176
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:39,540
publishing it out to the world to share,

177
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:41,610
if it's something that you
are saying; okay, this is my

178
00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:45,240
custom theme for myself or my client and

179
00:08:47,158 --> 00:08:49,323
I'm not going to sell it or give it away,

180
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:52,520
then I still highly recommend

181
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:55,120
you do this

182
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,500
this accessibility ready

183
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:00,560
required checks for your own custom theme

184
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:03,400
even if you're not going to
release it into the repository

185
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:06,700
and get that accessibility ready tag,

186
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:08,480
because this will make sure that you

187
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:11,740
have good accessible defaults
built into your theme

188
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:15,040
where you will need
minimal, if any plugins

189
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,030
to patch accessibility.

190
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:21,410
So going through this process
is highly, highly recommended

191
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:25,803
for making any kind of
custom parent theme.

192
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:28,820
And

193
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:33,430
lets talk about themes and editing now.

194
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:34,620
There was one other thing I did want

195
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:36,167
to talk about besides that--

196
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:39,050
Well that was the theme guidelines in the

197
00:09:39,050 --> 00:09:40,270
accessibility theme review,

198
00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:41,550
anybody have any thoughts on that?

199
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:44,350
Do you have a specific
process that you like to use

200
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:47,690
with custom theme development?

201
00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:51,630
There are just a number of different

202
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:54,285
starter theme frameworks.

203
00:09:54,285 --> 00:09:55,540
There's underscores

204
00:09:57,239 --> 00:09:58,072
from Automattic

205
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:03,780
that is fantastic starter framework

206
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:04,790
that

207
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:08,350
allows you to build up
your theme from scratch.

208
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:10,480
So we'll look at that real quick

209
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,840
before I move on to this next section.

210
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,300
So

211
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:16,020
underscores

212
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:18,843
dot me I believe is,

213
00:10:20,650 --> 00:10:22,000
yeah, okay so

214
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,040
this site has some contrast issues

215
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,823
as you can see on my screen,

216
00:10:27,852 --> 00:10:29,902
but this is a starter theme for WordPress

217
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:34,520
and it basically has a whole
lot that it just gives you

218
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:37,830
out-of-the-box then you
can go and customize

219
00:10:37,830 --> 00:10:39,430
and make your own.

220
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:40,263
So,

221
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:43,320
this underscores theme

222
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:46,400
is a really good starter theme

223
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:48,120
to then make your own parent theme,

224
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:50,400
make your own custom theme with it.

225
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,920
But there are a number of other ones too.

226
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:55,740
I think there's things called Bones,

227
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:56,573
there's,

228
00:10:58,100 --> 00:10:58,970
of course,

229
00:10:58,970 --> 00:11:02,310
you can start with frameworks
like Genesis Framework

230
00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:05,190
and then create your
own custom child theme

231
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:08,393
that's much like a parent theme with that.

232
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:13,110
There are just tons and
tons of resources out there

233
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:15,910
for having starter files with that,

234
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:20,410
I think foundations or
foundation has WordPress starter

235
00:11:20,410 --> 00:11:24,633
framework that you can use to
build your own custom theme.

236
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,010
So

237
00:11:27,010 --> 00:11:28,900
go out and do that but

238
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:29,760
when you do

239
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,400
look at the accessibility ready

240
00:11:34,573 --> 00:11:36,540
required attributes and all
of the documentation here

241
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:43,090
for getting your theme ready for that tag,

242
00:11:43,090 --> 00:11:44,440
even if you don't submit it

243
00:11:45,992 --> 00:11:47,950
to the theme review team.

244
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:51,230
If you go through this and
make it accessibility ready,

245
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:52,803
your users are gonna thank you.
