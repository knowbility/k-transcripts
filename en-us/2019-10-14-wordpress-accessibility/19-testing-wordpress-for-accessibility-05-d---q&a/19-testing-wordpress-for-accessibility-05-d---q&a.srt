00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:01,770
- [Instructor] So, the question is,

2
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:03,410
does anyone know if screen readers

3
00:00:03,410 --> 00:00:07,450
are sometimes mispronouncing,

4
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:11,360
or putting unexpected emphasis

5
00:00:13,309 --> 00:00:15,350
on content as it gets read out.

6
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:18,220
Like, skip to content links, right?

7
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:21,240
So, the answers is yes,
screen readers still have

8
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:23,800
that interesting little quirk about them,

9
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:28,800
where it may say skip to
content, like if you do this,

10
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:30,410
it's gonna make me content.

11
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:36,290
And yes, it will, screen
readers will pronounce things

12
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:40,280
in sometimes unexpected ways,

13
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:43,430
but as designers and developers,
we don't have to worry

14
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:47,640
about fixing all instances
of that in some way.

15
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:50,930
We don't have to jump through
flaming hoops to do that,

16
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:55,930
because a lot of these are
things that are conventions,

17
00:00:56,050 --> 00:00:59,880
or are very well known
to screen reader users,

18
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:02,350
and they may even have
changed their settings

19
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:04,060
to adjust for that,

20
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:05,950
or they may just have adjusted

21
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:07,550
their expectations around that,

22
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:11,040
where if they hear a skip to content link,

23
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,450
and they know it's skip to
the main content, that's okay.

24
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:18,580
They don't, it's okay that
it's pronounces it that way.

25
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:23,580
Folks understand how to navigate
using that pronunciation.

26
00:01:25,690 --> 00:01:29,750
So, sometimes acronyms can
get folks into trouble,

27
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:34,160
and that is where you may,

28
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:37,400
you may have uppercase text on a page,

29
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:41,500
and that uppercase text
gets read out phonetically,

30
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:44,770
or spelled out instead of read as a word.

31
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:45,820
So, there are some things

32
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:50,760
that you do need to do as best practice,

33
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:51,850
but in general,

34
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:56,030
screen readers do a
really good job with that.

35
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:59,010
So yeah, we'll take a look

36
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:01,620
at this real quick, this function.

37
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:03,530
So, this function...

38
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,600
just changes it.

39
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:15,183
Instead of skip to content,
it says skip to main content.

40
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:19,410
Think that's what you were talking about.

41
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:23,250
So yeah, I mean, you can,

42
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:26,250
I think that's a valid helper function

43
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:29,144
that you can have in there,

44
00:02:29,144 --> 00:02:31,270
and make it customizable.

45
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:32,800
What would be really awesome,

46
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,390
is to allow that to be customizable

47
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:36,950
through the theme customizations

48
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:38,750
that you might have with your theme.

49
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:41,750
So, what do you want that to read out as?

50
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:43,840
And I think that's
something that Joe Dolson,

51
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,410
with the WP Accessibility
plugin, has allowed people to do,

52
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:48,880
is to create custom links.

53
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:51,330
Because there are some sites,

54
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:54,670
and I'll show one right now.

55
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:56,203
No endorsement here.

56
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,930
I know people that either
love or hate Starbucks,

57
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:02,000
but they do a good job
with their skip links.

58
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,300
So, I've just gone to
the site, and I hit tab,

59
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:06,220
and at first it went

60
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:09,560
to this exciting updates
to Starbucks rewards.

61
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:12,640
So, it goes to that promo area first,

62
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:16,140
but the next tab stop is
skip to main navigation,

63
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:19,350
then skip to main content,
then skip to footer.

64
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:21,810
So, people can customize those skip links

65
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:26,810
and do some interesting
things with them, and really,

66
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,550
you can have more than one area

67
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:30,040
where you allow people to skip to

68
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:33,470
if people want to navigate that way.

69
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:36,790
That's a good use case
for usability testing,

70
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:38,120
is to find out,

71
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:41,840
what do people want when
they navigate our site?

72
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:42,980
And especially if you have

73
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:44,990
a lot of different areas of the site,

74
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:47,790
something like this that
I'm showing for Starbucks,

75
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:51,870
may be super handy to do.

76
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:56,870
But that is certainly a possibility.

77
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:03,150
And then, someone asked
about, at some point,

78
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:06,570
can we go over the reader
mode option in Firefox?

79
00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:10,750
It will basically strip things down,

80
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:13,150
and I know that we have that reader mode

81
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:14,680
on our mobile phones as well.

82
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:19,430
I know, with my iPhone,
a lot of sites will say

83
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:22,850
there's a reader option available,
and it can strip out ads

84
00:04:22,850 --> 00:04:24,380
and extraneous content.

85
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:25,560
We can certainly go over that.

86
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:28,040
I definitely want us to break for a bit.

87
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:30,970
Let's stop for about...

88
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:35,700
Well Christopher, what
do you think we should,

89
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:37,370
how long should we stop for?

90
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:40,210
And then, return, and then we can return

91
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:45,210
with that question for the reader mode.
