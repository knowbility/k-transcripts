1
00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:01.800
<v Robert Jolly>So today's agenda.</v>

2
00:00:03.128 --> 00:00:06.720
I want to cover Prerequisites and WordPress defaults,

3
00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.720
so that's going to be the first section of the day

4
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.080
and then we'll get into a longer section,

5
00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:17.193
WordPress Accessibility for Developers.

6
00:00:18.436 --> 00:00:23.436
So if you're developing a site using a theme of any sort,

7
00:00:23.582 --> 00:00:26.023
whether you're a theme developer or not,

8
00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.160
we'll cover content for you.

9
00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.760
And then we'll get into

10
00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:32.870
WordPress Accessibility for Content Authors

11
00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:34.343
after we break for lunch.

12
00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:39.120
We're going to get into the prerequisites, now,

13
00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.743
for what we feel like you need to know

14
00:00:41.743 --> 00:00:43.880
to spend the day with us.

15
00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:45.860
As we go through these prerequisites,

16
00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:48.160
I'm not going to go into detail.

17
00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.590
I'm assuming that you know most of this stuff.

18
00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:54.290
If you don't, that is A-Okay and you can raise an issue

19
00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:57.904
in Q &amp; A or in chat privately, if you want,

20
00:00:57.904 --> 00:00:59.954
and we can expand on any of these topics.

21
00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.000
So, what is accessibility?

22
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.623
I hope most of you that are here know this,

23
00:01:08.982 --> 00:01:13.010
but just for us to frame the conversation today

24
00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:15.720
and the training.

25
00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.650
Accessibility to me and to, I would say,

26
00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.700
most of us at Knowbility, if not all of us,

27
00:01:23.741 --> 00:01:27.757
is that accessibility is a barrier-free experience

28
00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:34.020
that anyone can have regardless of ability or disability.

29
00:01:36.034 --> 00:01:40.400
So it means that our work is usable by all.

30
00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.330
It is enjoyable by all.

31
00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:46.710
It's not, accessibility isn't something extra.

32
00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.630
It's something that we bake into what we do

33
00:01:50.611 --> 00:01:52.940
to make sure that our work is inclusive

34
00:01:55.152 --> 00:01:58.423
and does not present barriers to folks.

35
00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:03.080
There are some key accessibility principles

36
00:02:04.571 --> 00:02:08.100
that are very important to know

37
00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:11.300
and if you think about these principles,

38
00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:12.963
these 4 guiding principles,

39
00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:16.890
in the context of any of your accessibility work

40
00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:19.040
or any of your design and development work,

41
00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:22.640
you will succeed greatly.

42
00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:27.640
And these 4 accessibility principles are perceivable,

43
00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:32.920
so everything has to be able to be seen or heard

44
00:02:33.504 --> 00:02:34.854
or experienced in some way.

45
00:02:37.365 --> 00:02:38.923
So that guides all of the

46
00:02:40.367 --> 00:02:44.540
1 level accessibility guidelines

47
00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:46.500
from the web content accessibility guidelines.

48
00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:51.133
So when you see 1.3.1, that falls under perceivable.

49
00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:55.350
Then the next one is operable.

50
00:02:55.350 --> 00:03:00.130
So anything that you can operate in one method

51
00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:02.870
must be operable in all methods.

52
00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:06.093
So, say you can point and click at something with a mouse.

53
00:03:07.173 --> 00:03:08.720
You can also use a keyboard

54
00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:11.050
or an alternative input device for that

55
00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:13.983
so you can operate the interface.

56
00:03:15.766 --> 00:03:18.223
Anyone can do that without a barrier to that.

57
00:03:20.491 --> 00:03:23.400
And so, all of the 2.x.x,

58
00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:27.583
so 2.1.1 or 2.2.2,

59
00:03:28.667 --> 00:03:33.650
those guidelines fall under the operable principle.

60
00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:36.040
Then the next principle is understandable.

61
00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:39.440
So, any of the content that's presented to users

62
00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:41.640
must be understandable.

63
00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:43.130
Pretty self-explanatory.

64
00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:47.830
Those are the 3. WCAG guideline levels.

65
00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:51.950
And then robust is the last principle

66
00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:56.150
and that one makes up the 4. WCAG guidelines.

67
00:03:58.226 --> 00:04:03.226
So that acronym for the principles is P-O-U-R, POUR.

68
00:04:04.131 --> 00:04:09.131
They're highly valuable to me and to everyone that I know

69
00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:11.890
working in accessibility to keep in mind

70
00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:16.802
because I do not have the WCAG guidelines memorized.

71
00:04:16.802 --> 00:04:20.983
I know a few of them but, if I understand these principles,

72
00:04:21.972 --> 00:04:24.590
then I can look up guidelines and I can verify

73
00:04:26.696 --> 00:04:31.650
and confirm accessibility issues that I feel like

74
00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:35.280
might cause somebody trouble and then document them

75
00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:38.053
according to what the actual guidelines are.

76
00:04:39.115 --> 00:04:41.833
So those principles are extremely important.

77
00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:47.820
The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines, so WCAG.

78
00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:51.040
You'll hear me throw out terms like WCAG or

79
00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:54.283
Web Content Accessibility Guidelines or even A11Y,

80
00:04:55.125 --> 00:04:57.303
which is short hand for accessibility.

81
00:04:58.365 --> 00:05:02.514
There are 11 letters in between the A and the Y

82
00:05:02.514 --> 00:05:04.283
in the word accessibility.

83
00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:10.120
So WCAG, just understanding, in general, what it is,

84
00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:12.860
where to find the information for that.

85
00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:15.120
The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines

86
00:05:16.748 --> 00:05:20.561
is published by the W3C, so that is something

87
00:05:20.561 --> 00:05:22.923
that is very important to know.

88
00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:27.133
Then having general WordPress knowledge, of course,

89
00:05:28.093 --> 00:05:29.843
since this is a WordPress training.

90
00:05:31.134 --> 00:05:33.961
We need to understand how to,

91
00:05:33.961 --> 00:05:38.280
how to build WordPress sites in general.

92
00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:41.830
Even if its something like using a host

93
00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:44.640
to do a one-click install of your WordPress site

94
00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:46.730
and then logging in, right?

95
00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:48.530
That is general WordPress knowledge.

96
00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:53.028
Obviously, if you have additional WordPress knowledge,

97
00:05:53.028 --> 00:05:54.003
that will help you greatly.

98
00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:57.280
Familiarity and Comfort with F.E.D.

99
00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:00.523
So Front End Design or Front End Development.

100
00:06:01.534 --> 00:06:02.670
So Front End Design and Development

101
00:06:04.249 --> 00:06:06.370
is a combination of technologies.

102
00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:10.470
We frequently use F.E.D. to represent

103
00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:13.070
HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

104
00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:17.090
So those are the technologies that power the web

105
00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:21.830
and that is something that is very important,

106
00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:24.330
at least for this developer portion of the course.
